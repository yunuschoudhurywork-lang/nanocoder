# 1.31.0

- Publish a JSON Schema for `agents.config.json` as `schemas/agents.config.schema.json`. It is generated deterministically from the on-disk `DiskConfig` type (`pnpm run generate:schema`), ships with an Ajv validation suite plus a CI drift check, and enables editor autocompletion — either by dropping the `$schema` key into your config or by wiring up the schema via `jsonValidation` / a JSON Schema mapping in your editor.
- Added Anthropic prompt caching. The system prompt, tool schemas, and conversation history are now marked with cache breakpoints, so multi-turn sessions read the stable prefix back out of cache instead of paying full price for it every turn. Cost reporting is cache-aware throughout: `/usage` and the per-response indicator price cache reads and writes at their own rates instead of billing every cache hit at the full input rate, and the per-response indicator surfaces the cached token count alongside the total. Opt out with `"promptCaching": false` on the provider config. Closes #888.
- Fix multi-line paste submitting the prompt partway through, and add a selection mode for fullscreen.

Nanocoder never enabled bracketed paste, so the terminal delivered a paste as bare bytes and the carriage return at each line break reached Ink's keypress parser as Enter. Pasting two lines sent the first line to the model and left the second in the input box. Paste handling relied entirely on heuristics (input rate, size, line count) that only ever saw text which had already made it into the buffer.

DECSET 2004 is now enabled in both screen modes. Paste payloads are lifted off stdin before Ink sees them and delivered to the input as a single event, so a pasted newline can no longer submit. The old heuristics remain as a fallback for terminals without bracketed paste support.

Fullscreen mode (`--alt-screen`) enables mouse reporting for wheel scrolling, which takes click-drag text selection away from the terminal. **Ctrl+P** now toggles selection mode, suspending mouse reporting so you can select and copy normally, and resuming it on the next press. Inline mode, the default, never enables mouse reporting and is unaffected.
- Grouped each VS Code chat turn's thoughts, tool calls, edit cards, and task plan into one ordered, collapsible work summary while leaving the final answer visible. The summary reports completed, stopped, or failed duration and reopens for pending approvals. Thanks to @Gambit-Checkmate. Closes #858.
- Added support for a .nanocoderignore file. Patterns in it keep tracked-but-noisy files (lockfiles, generated fixtures) out of directory listings, file search and the file explorer, so they stop eating context even though .gitignore doesn't cover them. It is a context-hygiene tool rather than a secrets boundary: read_file and execute_bash don't consult it, and checkpoints deliberately skip it so hidden files are still snapshotted and restored. Thanks to @A-S-Manoj. Closes #755.
- Add configurable agent-loop retry limits to prevent token drain (#897). A new `nanocoder.retries` section in `agents.config.json` exposes the previously hardcoded caps: `maxRepeatedToolCalls` (default 3), `maxEmptyTurns` (default 2), and `maxMalformedRetries` (default 2). When the repeated-tool-call limit is hit in an interactive session, Nanocoder now pauses and asks whether to continue (granting another window of attempts) or stop, instead of always hard-stopping; non-interactive runs keep the hard stop. The same limits now also protect the `--plain` runtime used by `nanocoder run` in CI and non-TTY environments, which previously had no repeated-call cap at all: each cap hard-stops with a clear error there. Note this also loosens `--plain` in two places: it used to return an error on the *first* empty response and on the *first* malformed tool call, and it now nudges or asks the model to self-correct up to `maxEmptyTurns` / `maxMalformedRetries` before stopping, so a silent or malformed-output model costs up to 3 model calls instead of 1. Set either limit to `0` to restore the old fail-fast behaviour. Calls to unknown tools count toward the repeated-call streak in both runtimes, so a model stuck on a nonexistent tool trips the same cap instead of looping until the turn ceiling. Delegated subagent runs, whose loop previously had no cap at all, now apply `maxRepeatedToolCalls` too and stop with an error naming the setting.

One change reaches further than the retry limits themselves: a tool call naming a tool that does not exist is now kept in the assistant message's `tool_calls` rather than dropped from it. Without this the paired `Unknown tool: X` result was orphaned and pruned before the request went out, so the self-correction hint never reached the model and it re-emitted the same nonexistent call. This applies to all three runtimes that partition tool calls, including the ACP loop (`--acp`, used by editor clients), which is otherwise unaffected by the retry limits. The practical consequence is that providers now receive a tool call naming a tool that was not in the request's tool list.
- Auto-generate descriptive filenames for /export instead of generic timestamps. Closes #934

Exports are now contained to the project directory, matching read_file / write_file / string_replace: `~` is not expanded and absolute paths outside the project root are refused rather than written. Rejections name the specific cause (null byte, `~`, `..` segment, outside the root) instead of failing generically.
- Added bundled React, Next.js, and Rust project presets for `nanocoder init --preset <type>` and `/init --preset <type>`. Presets seed analyzed `AGENTS.md` guidance, stack-specific context ignores, and a `/check` command skill while preserving existing files. Closes #1008.
- toggle todo-list visibility using ctrl-t
- Auto-compact now runs on `--plain`, ACP, and subagent loops, not just the TUI. Subagents also honour `sessions.maxMessages`. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #1048.
- Added discoverable usage tips to the welcome screen and a `/tip` command for showing another tip on demand. `/tip <text>` narrows the pick to tips mentioning that text, and consecutive runs will not repeat the tip they just showed. Thanks to @OllieinCanada. Closes #929.
- Added a **terminal bell** option to notifications. Every notifier Nanocoder had was desktop-only — `terminal-notifier`, `osascript`, `notify-send`, the PowerShell balloon — so anyone driving Nanocoder over SSH, inside tmux, or from a remote container got nothing at all when a long run finished. `notifications.bell` now also writes a BEL character to stdout for whichever events you have enabled, which the terminal in front of you renders as a beep or a visual flash. Toggle it under `/settings` → Input → Notifications, next to Sound. BEL is non-printing, so it does not disturb the rendered frame, and it is skipped when stdout is not a TTY so piped output and daemon logs stay clean. Also corrected the notification docs, which described the preference as living under a `nanocoder.notifications` namespace — it is read from the top-level `notifications` key, so anything written at the documented path was silently ignored. Closes #931.
- Optional OS sandbox for `execute_bash` / `!` (`nanocoder.sandbox`, default off). macOS uses sandbox-exec, Linux uses bubblewrap or errors instead of falling through, Windows is unsupported. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #1049.
- Added an action timeline in the VS Code sidebar so you can click a prior mutating tool step and revert the workspace files and conversation back to that point.
- Added a `professionalTone` preference (`/settings` → Behavior → Professional Tone). When on, the end-of-turn note drops its random adjective ("Completed in 12s." instead of "Worked for a plucky 12s.") and the system prompt gains a TONE section instructing the model to stay terse and strictly functional — no filler, no preamble, no celebratory wrap-ups.
- Add automatic collapsing for long user messages in the conversation view. Messages exceeding 40 words or 300 characters are collapsed for display, while the original prompt remains intact and can be recalled from input history.
- Added lifecycle hooks: shell commands configured under `nanocoder.hooks` in `agents.config.json` that run at fixed points in the agent loop — `session-start`, `session-end`, `user-prompt-submit`, `pre-tool-use`, `post-tool-use`, and `pre-compact`. Hooks cost no tokens and fire every time, so rules the model used to be merely asked to remember ("format after every edit", "never touch .env") are now enforced. A `pre-tool-use` or `user-prompt-submit` hook that exits non-zero denies the action and its stdout goes back to the model as the reason; the tool gate runs ahead of the approval decision, so a vetoed tool never renders a confirmation prompt. A hook that hangs past its timeout is killed along with its whole process tree and skipped, rather than wedging the session. `post-tool-use` output is folded into the tool result — including when the tool failed, so an audit hook sees the errors too — and `session-start` output is injected as context on the next chat prompt, leaving slash commands and `!` bash passthroughs untouched. Hooks run from the project root so a relative command survives a `cd`, and `session-end` defaults to a shorter timeout that fits inside the shutdown budget. The tool hooks apply on every surface that runs tools — the interactive TUI (including streamed `execute_bash`), `run`, `--plain`, ACP, and subagents — the session and prompt hooks cover the TUI and `run`/`--plain`, and `/doctor` lists what a project has wired up. Closes #1032.
- Added `/repomap`, a local codebase map. Nanocoder indexes the symbols defined in each source file, links files that reference each other's symbols into a directed graph, and ranks that graph with PageRank - so the map leads with the files the rest of the codebase leans on most. Everything runs on your machine with no LLM round-trip, covering TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java/Kotlin/C#/Swift, Ruby, PHP, and C/C++. The map is budgeted to 1024 tokens by default; `/repomap --tokens <n>` widens it. Thanks to @akramcodez. Refs #890.
- Retired the legacy `.nanocoder/tasks.json` file in the working directory. Task state is now session-scoped and stored with the session's other artifacts under the app data directory, so nanocoder no longer writes agent bookkeeping into your repository and two concurrent sessions no longer share one task list. Resuming a session restores its tasks. Any leftover `.nanocoder/tasks.json` is ignored and can be deleted.
- File search (path matching and content search) is now backed by `ripgrep` instead of a hand-rolled JS walker.

Search also respects `.nanocoderignore` and binary files again, matching `list_directory` and file autocomplete.

A failed search now reports the failure instead of returning an empty result set.

`.nanocoderignore` directories are skipped during the walk rather than filtered afterwards, so a large ignored directory can no longer crowd real files out of the results.
- Added a dedicated Semantic Memory toggle to `/settings` under Advanced, backed by the `semanticMemoryEnabled` preference. The setting defaults on to preserve existing behavior, and can be turned off to keep agents from persisting reusable context across sessions.
- Added a session-scoped artifact lifecycle to the CLI and VS Code: implementation plans with explicit review and prose-plan fallback persistence, persistent task tracking, completion walkthroughs after an approved plan, clickable artifact shortcuts that survive session resume, and reliable cancellation recovery. Task lists now live with the session instead of `.nanocoder/tasks.json` in your project, so `/clear` starts a fresh list while the previous session keeps its record. Plan approval always works, falling back to the plan in the transcript when no artifact was written. Headless `--plain` runs keep their artifacts ephemeral and are not forced to produce a walkthrough. Subagents can no longer reach the plan, task, or walkthrough tools, and their declared `tools:` allow-list is now enforced when a tool runs rather than only when the tool set is offered. Thanks to @2409324124. Closes #805.
- Add `/stats` lifetime usage command with 7d / 3m / all-time ranges (←/→ to switch), cumulative token chart, peak day, streak, and top provider·model pairs. Thanks to @puri-adityakumar. Closes #933.
- Syntax highlighting now follows your theme, and takes a `syntaxTheme` preference when you want code to keep a palette of its own. All five highlighting call sites - markdown code blocks, `string_replace` diff context, the `write_file` preview, and the file explorer preview - passed `theme: 'default'`, a string where `cli-highlight` expects a token-to-formatter map, so the option was silently dropped and every theme rendered code identically in the library's own colours. Each one now derives its token map from a theme's palette: keywords take `primary`, built-ins and declarations `tool`, strings `success`, numbers `warning`, comments `secondary`, attributes and variables `info`, and everything else the theme's body `text`. Code follows `selectedTheme` by default; setting `syntaxTheme` in `nanocoder-preferences.json` (e.g. `"syntaxTheme": "dracula"`) points code at any other theme's palette while the rest of the UI stays put, and an unknown name falls back to `selectedTheme` rather than dropping the styling. Closes #935.
- Added created and modified files to the VS Code extension's context panel: every file the agent writes during a turn now appears as a chip above the composer as soon as the edit lands, and clicking it opens the current version in the editor for review. The chips are dashed to set them apart from files you attached yourself, survive sending a message, and can be dismissed individually or, for a turn that touched many files, all at once with a "Clear N changed files" control; the row scrolls at a fixed height rather than growing the composer. They are deliberately not inlined into the next prompt, since the agent just wrote them. The row follows the rest of the file lifecycle too - a deleted file loses its chip, and a rename moves the chip to the new path. Two tools also report themselves more accurately over ACP as a result: `diff_edit` is now an edit, so edits from the nano tool profile get the same file card and chip that `write_file` and `string_replace` already did, and `file_op` reports the kind its operation actually performs (delete, move, or an edit for a copy) instead of a generic tool call. Closes #857.

- Fixed `ask_user` rejecting 5-6 options over ACP. The tool schema allows 2-6 options, but the ACP path used by the VS Code extension capped them at 4, so an identical prompt succeeded in the CLI and failed in the editor. The bound now matches the schema, and the error string returned to the model says "2-6" rather than telling it the limit is 4 and pushing it to retry with a needlessly narrowed list. Closes #1036.
- Fixed sub-agent tool calls being denied silently under ACP. A tool call made inside a dispatched sub-agent went through the global approval slot, which no ACP code path installed a handler for, so its safe fallback denied every one without the client seeing a `session/request_permission`. Delegated work could only write by bypassing approval entirely, which was invisible to a client that gates writes. Sub-agent calls now use the same permission channel as top-level ones, announced first so the request names a known tool call, prefixed so their cards cannot collide with a top-level id, and titled with the sub-agent so the client can tell them apart. The handler is scoped to the turn that installs it, so it no longer outlives that turn holding a finished session. Two known limits remain. The approval slot is still a process-wide singleton, so while two sessions have turns in flight at once the later one's handler answers the earlier one's approvals, against the wrong session id and abort controller; closing that needs the slot keyed by session or an approval channel threaded through the sub-agent executor. And an approved sub-agent call is marked `completed` as soon as it is approved rather than when it runs, because the sub-agent layer does not report results back, so a client sees `completed` for a tool that may still fail. Note also that sub-agent approvals ignore the ACP session's mode and the configured `alwaysAllow` list, so a `yolo` or `auto-accept` session is prompted inside a sub-agent for a tool it would not be prompted for at top level. Closes #1019.
- Fix fetch_url truncation warning to display the content limit in characters.
- Preserve every copy of repeated pasted text through placeholder display, chunked updates, and prompt assembly.
- Grouped the VS Code chat composer controls: model stays on the input row, the current approval mode stays visible on the gear, and provider plus mode pickers live in a Configuration popover. Closes #859.
- Fixed subagent tool results that return structured data without `llmContent` so the complete output is preserved for the model instead of being passed as `undefined`. Closes #1033.
- Custom tool `cwd` now stays inside the project after symlink and `${VAR}` resolution. A `cwd` that really resolves outside the project - an absolute path, `${HOME}`, a `../` traversal, or an in-repo symlink pointing out - now fails the tool call with `Custom tool cwd escapes the project directory` rather than running the script somewhere unexpected. A missing `cwd` still falls back to the project root. Closes #1027.
- Custom tools on Windows now spawn `cmd.exe /d /s /c` instead of `-c`, which cmd does not accept. `/d` skips AutoRun; `/s` makes quote stripping deterministic. `{{ }}` substitution stays POSIX-quoted and is not shell-safe under cmd. Closes #1028.
- Fixed `nanocoder daemon logs` returning only a sliver of the tail when a single oversized log line runs past the start of the 64KB window. Realigning the window to the first line break discarded everything before it, so a log holding one long serialized payload came back as just the few bytes that followed. The tail now only realigns when a line break is near the start of the window, and otherwise keeps the partial first line.
- Fixed `nanocoder daemon logs` reading the whole log file into memory to return its last 64KB, so a long-running daemon with a large log made the command allocate the entire file and stall. The tail is now streamed from a byte offset, which also corrects a byte offset applied to a decoded string: any multi-byte content in the log shifted the window and returned far less than the intended 64KB. Closes #1042.
- Document the tool output convention for file content and add a regression test.
- fetch_url now blocks the whole `.localhost` zone, not just the bare `localhost` label. RFC 6761 reserves it for loopback and systemd-resolved resolves every label under it to 127.0.0.1, so `http://foo.localhost` reached a local service on Linux. Real hosts that merely contain the string (`localhost.example.com`) are unaffected.
- fetch_url now rejects the request URL inside execute, not only the validator. readOnly tools skip confirmation, so yolo/headless/subagents never ran the old hostname list. Blocks loopback CIDR, RFC1918, and GCP metadata names (`metadata`, `metadata.goog`, `metadata.google.internal`). HTTP redirects and DNS rebinding are not covered (#1089).
- Consolidated the atomic-deletion overlap checks onto a single half-open `[start, end)` range helper, so the boundary tests that had drifted between `<` and `<=` now agree by construction rather than by coincidence. Deletion behaviour is unchanged - the longhand forms were already equivalent for every reachable input. Placeholder lookup at a cursor position does change: a position now counts as on a placeholder when it falls in `(start, end]`, so the position immediately before a placeholder reads as outside it and the position immediately after it reads as inside, matching where the cursor actually sits when you press Backspace. Thanks to @hiarun02. Closes #977.
- Fixed checkpoints irrecoverably corrupting binary files. Every layer of the pipeline read and wrote contents as UTF-8, so each byte of an image, `.vsix` bundle or database came back as U+FFFD — and because the damage was done at save time, the checkpoint itself held nothing left to recover. Snapshots are now carried as `Buffer` and written with no encoding argument; text still round-trips byte-identically.

A checkpoint that came out incomplete also restored in silence. Files that could not be read at capture, and files dropped by the `MAX_CHECKPOINT_FILES` cap, are now recorded on the checkpoint's metadata and named when it is restored. Old checkpoints still load, though binaries captured before this fix stay corrupt. Closes #962.
- Fix Expand Tool Results label inverted and compactToolDisplay preference never read at startup
- Fixed `--context-max` and `/context-max` silently accepting malformed values. `10kg` used to parse as `10` and `128kb` as `128`, so a typo quietly set a context limit nothing like the one you asked for. The value is now validated as a whole, and anything that is not a positive number with an optional `k`/`K` suffix is rejected with the existing error message. Values large enough to overflow to `Infinity` are rejected too, rather than being stored as a session limit. Thanks to @hiarun02. Closes #973.
- Closed the remaining routes by which nanocoder's own UI text reached the model. The ACP timeline-revert notice ("Reverted to before step N…") was still pushed into history as a plain assistant message, and `/compact` (plus auto-compact) fed display-only notices into the LLM summariser, whose summary re-enters context as a real `user` message — so a compacted session could still be told it had errored. Notices are now excluded from the summarised segment, and context-usage estimates and the auto-compact threshold count only what the provider actually receives. Also documents the `displayOnly` contract on `Message`, warns when a display-only message carries `tool_calls` (which would silently drop its tool results from the payload), and shares the "Tool approval required for: " prefix as a constant so the non-interactive exit-code path can't break on a reword.
- Stopped nanocoder's own UI text from being sent to the model as its past output. Cancellation notices (`_Cancelled by user._`), inline error banners (`**Error:** ...`), the non-interactive "Tool approval required" notice, and the VS Code replies to built-in slash commands (`/help`, `/copy`, `/model`, unrecognized commands) were all pushed into conversation history as `assistant` messages, so on the next turn the provider received harness-authored markdown as if the model had written it — teaching it to imitate the chrome and, on a resumed session, to believe it had errored. These are now marked display-only: they still render in the chat and replay with session history, but they are filtered out before messages are converted to the provider payload. Closes #893.
- Fixed message compression so resolution text only marks an error resolved when it appears after that error.
- Fixed a paste restored from an older session's prompt history being sent to the model as its own label. Placeholder lookup now matches on each entry's display text, but entries persisted before placeholders carried a `displayText` have none, so they were skipped and their `[Paste #N: X chars]` label survived into the prompt instead of expanding to the pasted content. Those entries now have their label rebuilt from the ordinal in their key and the content they hold, matching the legacy fallback that the display-text lookup replaced.
- Fix the exported inline-diff similarity helper name from `areLinesSimlar` to `areLinesSimilar`. Thanks to @hafzism. Closes #968.
- Fixed `string_replace` and `diff_edit` corrupting edits whose replacement text contains `$`. Both tools passed the model's replacement straight to `String.prototype.replace`, which treats that argument as a substitution template rather than a literal: `$$` collapsed to a single `$`, `$&` expanded to the matched text, and ``$` ``/`$'` spliced a whole half of the file into the middle of the edit. Those are ordinary characters in shell scripts, Makefiles, CI YAML and anything that builds a regex, so the bytes on disk silently diverged from the diff the user approved. Replacements are now spliced by index, so the approved preview - in the terminal and over ACP - is what lands. Closes #1057.
- Include the provider in the message token cache key. The tokenizer is chosen from provider and model together, so two providers serving the same model name were sharing cache entries and could report counts produced by the other provider's tokenizer.
- Fix a startup crash when `package.json` is missing, unreadable, or malformed. Both module-load reads of the version (`cli.tsx` and the welcome banner) threw before any error handling existed, taking down the CLI on a misbuilt install. Version lookup now lives in a single helper that falls back to `unknown`, shared by the banner, `/help`, and `/doctor` (which previously reported a misleading `0.0.0`).
- Fixed paste detection extracting the wrong text from the input buffer. It assumed every insertion was appended at the end, so pasting with the cursor anywhere but the end stored a truncated placeholder, and deletions or unchanged input reported a slice from the middle of the string. Detection now diffs the buffer against its previous revision and ignores non-positive deltas. Closes #979.
- Fixed paste placeholders silently overwriting each other. Placeholder ids were derived from the number of live entries, so deleting one freed its id for reuse and the next paste clobbered a placeholder that was still in the input - destroying its content and leaving a duplicate label that got sent to the model as literal text. Ids are now namespaced by type (`paste_1`, `file_1`) and allocated from the highest id ever used, so a deletion can never free an id. Placeholder lookup now matches on each entry's own display text instead of a paste-shaped regex, which also makes `@file` mentions delete atomically rather than leaving an orphan entry behind, and lets two placeholders that render identically expand to their own content.
- Reject unsupported `skill:<name>` subscription targets with a clear error instead of registering subscriptions that cannot dispatch. Thanks to @1cbyc. Closes #1011.
- Fixed a regression where the VS Code extension webview rendered without theme colors after the Tailwind v4 upgrade by migrating custom color variables to an `@theme` block in the CSS.
- Fix auto-compact silently no-opping in the TUI after the shared-helper refactor. `maybeAutoCompact` derived the provider and model from the client and swallowed any failure, so the chat loop's own `currentProvider`/`currentModel` were ignored; it now accepts them as explicit overrides. Auto-compact in `--plain`, ACP, and subagent loops also stops writing the message cap back into stored history when no compaction ran.
- Fixed update command error detection when later output reports zero errors. Thanks to @anisayakmitra-in. Closes #974.
- Fix web_search TimeoutError not correctly captured as a timeout error
- Fixed `file.changed` skill subscriptions silently never firing on Windows. Chokidar reports changed files using the platform separator, so a documented pattern like `docs/**` was asked to match `docs\guide.md` and never could — the daemon started, reported healthy, logged nothing, and did nothing. The same mismatch let a root-scoped pattern such as `*.md` match the nested `sub\a.md`, dispatching an unattended agent run against a file that was deliberately scoped out. Paths are now normalized to `/` at the watcher boundary, so the router, activity reports, and the payload handed to a triggered agent all read one path shape. Closes #964.
- Fixed models cache path on Windows by using `os.homedir()` instead of `process.env.HOME`, which is undefined on Windows. The cache now writes to the correct location instead of creating a literal `~` folder.
- Fixed skill subscriptions never firing for a brace pattern such as `*.{ts,tsx}`. The event router's glob matcher escaped `{`, `}` and `,` as literals, so the pattern only matched a path that literally contained the braces. Braces now expand to an alternation, and an unbalanced brace stays literal rather than building a regex that would throw. Negation (`!`) is still unsupported. Closes #1012.
- Fixed a leaked pending slot in the daemon IPC client. If serializing or writing a request threw synchronously, the request's entry stayed in the pending map for the lifetime of the client, one per failed request. The slot is now released and the request rejected explicitly. Closes #1040.
- Hardened the VS Code action timeline: it no longer snapshots its own before-images, skips a checkpoint rather than recording a wrong one when the workspace scan is truncated, leaves binary files alone, reverts a whole assistant turn at once, validates paths read back from the timeline index, and keeps the chat thread on screen when a revert is refused.
- Fixed the daemon socket path on Unix when a deeply nested project pushes it past the `sockaddr_un.sun_path` limit (104 bytes on macOS, 108 on Linux). libuv silently truncates overlong paths rather than failing, so the daemon reported a socket it never bound, its stale-socket cleanup missed the real file, and two projects sharing a truncation prefix could collide on a single socket. Nanocoder now falls back to a stable hashed socket name under the system temp directory (or `/tmp` if `TMPDIR` is itself too long), and `daemon start` reports the path the daemon actually bound instead of recomputing it.
- Fixed MCP tools bypassing the development-mode policy that governs every other tool. MCP built its own approval predicate rather than routing through the central mode system, which failed in two directions: a tool on a server's `alwaysAllow` list collapsed to "never needs approval" in *every* mode, so plan mode executed mutating MCP tools with no prompt despite being the mode you switch into specifically to inspect an untrusted model's intentions without side effects; and every other MCP tool required approval in headless, where no approval handler exists, so daemon-triggered skill runs failed with "Tool execution was denied by the user" when no user was ever asked. MCP tools now take the same posture as built-in tools — headless runs them unattended like `execute_bash` and the file tools, and plan mode gates them on the server's `readOnlyHint` annotation, treating an unannotated tool as a possible mutation and hiding it. A server's `alwaysAllow` list now applies in normal mode only, as its documentation already stated, and can no longer override plan mode. `readOnlyHint` decides plan-mode availability only: because it is supplied by the same server being gated, it never skips a confirmation prompt in normal mode — the user's own `alwaysAllow` list remains the only way to do that.
- Fixed `ToolManager.disconnectMCP()` rebuilding the whole tool registry from the built-in exports and clearing the custom tool map. The `unregisterMany()` call above it already removes exactly the MCP tools, so the rebuild was redundant, and it discarded three other things with them: workspace custom tools along with the `approval` and `read_only` metadata that plan and headless filtering read, skill and bundle tools registered through `registerSkillTool()`, and the constructor's removal of `web_search` when no Brave Search key is configured, which came back as an unusable tool. The only caller today is the shutdown handler registered in `initializeMCP`, where discarding state is harmless, so nothing user-facing changes. The method is public and any other caller would have hit all four. Closes #1034.
- Confined the MCP `readOnlyHint` annotation to plan-mode availability, and made `"enabled": false` actually disable an MCP server. The `readOnlyHint` a server reports was being copied onto its registered tool entries, where `ToolManager.isReadOnly()` also decides whether ACP captures a checkpoint before the call and whether the tool joins a parallel execution batch — so a server annotating itself read-only could talk its way out of a restore point. The hint now lives on the MCP tool mapping, which only plan-mode filtering reads, exactly as the documentation describes. Separately, `enabled` was loaded from config and then ignored: every configured server connected regardless, including in headless runs where MCP tools execute unattended and `"enabled": false` is the only documented opt-out. Disabled servers are now skipped before any connection is attempted.
- Moved the VS Code mode selector onto the chat composer row with accessible mode labels and dropdown state.
- Fixed the `/settings` → Notifications panel dropping the `triggeredRunComplete` event. The panel seeded its fallback config with only three events and rendered a row for each, then wrote the whole object back on every toggle - so flipping any switch persisted a preference with no `triggeredRunComplete` key, and the daemon's "triggered run completed" notification silently stopped firing. The event now has a default and a row of its own. Also corrected the paste docs, which described the threshold as living under a `nanocoder.paste` namespace when it is read from the top-level `paste` key (the same error just fixed for `notifications`), documented the `triggeredRunComplete` event in both preference tables, and noted that the terminal bell needs the master Notifications toggle on and that tmux swallows the bell unless `monitor-bell` is enabled.
- follow-ups to the Ctrl-T task-list toggle: the status-bar badge now yields space under width pressure instead of squeezing the session name and editor pill, the unread marker only fires on real task changes, and the "todo" naming is aligned with the "Tasks" list it summarises
- Fixed a slash command with leading whitespace being sent to the model as a chat message instead of running. `parseInput` trims before testing for the `/` prefix but the routing in `handleMessageSubmission` did not, so `  /help` reached the LLM. With lifecycle hooks configured it also fired `user-prompt-submit` and consumed buffered `session-start` context for an input that never reaches the model. Both the routing and the hook's local-action check now trim, matching the `!` bash passthrough. Also added `nanocoder.hooks` to the `agents.config.json` JSON Schema — hooks landed alongside the schema and were missing from it, so every documented hooks example was flagged as an unknown key in editors.
- Update the message token cache in place instead of copying every entry into a new map on each cache miss.
- Professional Tone now applies as soon as you toggle it in `/settings`. Previously the completion note changed immediately but the system prompt's TONE section waited for the next mode or model switch, so the model kept its old register and the toggle looked broken. `buildSystemPrompt` also takes `professionalTone` as an explicit argument instead of reading the preference file itself.
- Professional Tone now uses a shortened TONE section under the `nano` tool profile, matching how every other prompt section is slimmed for tiny models. The full section cost ~695 characters on a prompt that is deliberately minimal; the nano variant is ~228.
- Fixed ACP prompts racing with each other by claiming session turns before asynchronous setup begins, preventing overlapping prompts from corrupting turn state. Built-in slash-command replies are kept in persisted session history for replay, while command-only sessions are not saved. Closes #1038.
- Fixed `{{args}}` in custom commands without declared parameters so it receives the raw command arguments instead of an empty string. Closes #1035.
- Fixed two `/repomap` indexing bugs and added a progress spinner. Python docstring bodies are no longer indexed as definitions (the `"""` and `'''` branches were unreachable in the comment-stripping pattern, so names inside a docstring were reported as real symbols and sorted ahead of them), and a repo holding exactly `maxFiles` indexable files is no longer reported as truncated. `/repomap` now shows a "Building repo map" spinner while it scans, and reuses the shared `calculateTokens` helper for its budget maths.
- Fixed the VS Code extension dropping token and estimated-cost footers when a saved chat is reopened. Completed ACP turns now persist their response usage on the matching assistant message and restore it during history replay, while existing sessions without usage metadata continue to load unchanged. Closes #1097.
- Restored the VS Code panel features a bad merge in #898 reverted: the action timeline and its undo, slash command autocomplete, editor-tab drag and drop, the MCP settings button opening `.mcp.json`, and the denied-edit status icon. The work summary from #898 is kept, and no longer opens a second box that never settles when a tool reports back after Stop, nor a box for whitespace-only reasoning.
- Prevent `fetch_url` from following HTTP redirects before the destination has been validated, protecting the no-approval tool from redirect-based access to private and loopback addresses. Closes #1089.
- Wire semantic memory recall into subagent and daemon runs, serialize writes across manager instances and processes, and cap each repo memory file at 500 entries.
- Rank recalled memories by how much of the query they cover, skip tool-call narration in reversal detection, and drop noisy `/memory propose` candidates.
- Added a visual `saving` indicator in the CLI status line that briefly displays whenever session state is autosaved to disk. Thanks to @rishu685. Closes #932.
- Fixed checkpoints capturing no files in a repository with no commits. `getModifiedFilesResult` diffed against `HEAD`, which does not exist on an unborn branch, so the whole scan fell to its catch and reported git as unavailable — every file in a `git init`ed workspace looked unmodified, and a checkpoint taken there restored nothing. The scan now checks for `HEAD` first and diffs the index with `git diff --name-only --cached` when there is none, so a staged tree (`git init && git add .`, or `git checkout --orphan`, which starts with a fully populated index) is captured rather than skipped; `--others` alone would have missed all of it, because `git ls-files --others` excludes anything already in the index. This affects checkpoint creation and both timeline scans, which branch on the `available` flag. A genuine `git diff` failure still falls through to the existing error handling and reports git as unavailable, unchanged.
- Fix session selector dismissing on any keypress instead of only Escape when no sessions exist
- Added slash command quick actions to the VS Code extension chat panel. Typing `/` in the input opens an autocomplete menu listing `/test`, `/explain`, and `/doc`, which insert a human-readable prompt template into the textarea so the user sees and can edit exactly what gets sent, alongside the existing `/clear` and `/copy` commands, which complete to their name and run as they always have. The menu only opens on a slash that starts a line, so URLs and paths are left alone.

# 1.30.0

- Added first-class provider template for Groq to the setup wizard.
- Added first-class provider template for OrcaRouter to the setup wizard.
- Added a /commit slash command that generates Conventional Commit messages from staged Git diffs using the active LLM client. Thanks to @DeepamJha. Closes #757.
- Consolidated upload actions under a single '+' menu in the VS Code webview to reduce UI clutter and improve scalability for future attachment types.
- Added context attachment functionality with UI for file/folder chips and drag-and-drop support.
- Added Settings Tab to the VS Code extension webview for configuring providers and behavior directly from the UI.
- `list_directory` no longer includes file sizes by default — they cost an `lstat` syscall per file plus output tokens for information that's rarely needed just to orient in a directory. Pass `showSizes=true` to opt back in, or use `read_file` with `metadata_only=true` for a single file's size.
- Added a per-response token usage and estimated cost indicator. Every assistant message in the CLI now ends with a subtle gray footer showing the provider-reported token count and estimated cost (e.g. `Tokens: 4.2k | ~$0.01`), computed from models.dev pricing; the cost segment is omitted for local/free models and the footer falls back to the previous client-side estimate when the provider reports no usage. The VS Code extension shows the same indicator under each finished response, fed by the per-turn usage now returned on the ACP prompt response. Note: the estimate prices all input tokens at the standard rate — cache read/write discounts are not factored in, so costs can be overstated for providers with prompt caching. Closes #756.
- Moved the rest of nanocoder's configuration into the `/settings` menu, so you can set things up without editing `.json` files by hand. Settings are grouped into Appearance, Input, Behavior, Providers, MCP, and Advanced tabs. New menu items let you set the default mode, auto-compact, sessions, reasoning traces, tool auto-approval, and a Web Search API key; view your configured providers and MCP servers before opening the setup wizards; open the Tune Model and Connect IDE wizards; and see the active `NANOCODER_*` environment variables. Advanced also includes an in-app JSON editor for `agents.config.json`: edit strings with the cursor inside the quotes, flip booleans with the arrow keys, and save atomically (a crash can't leave a half-written file).
- Sunset `/setup-providers` and `/setup-mcp` in favour of `/settings`. Both retired names still work for now — they open the matching `/settings` tab with a notice instead of erroring. `/settings` now takes a tab argument (`/settings providers`, `/settings mcp`), MCP has its own settings tab, and provider edits made from settings apply to the running session instead of waiting for the next launch. Selecting a provider or MCP server in settings now opens that entry's edit/delete choice directly, with a separate row for adding a new one.
- Added editor code lenses to the VS Code extension: every function, method, constructor and class now carries `Explain Code` and `Generate Tests` links, and clicking one reveals the chat view and sends that symbol - instruction, `file:startLine-endLine` and the source, fenced with the document language - as a prompt. Symbols come from the language server, so no per-language parsing is involved, and the lenses can be turned off with `nanocoder.codeLens`. Long symbols are capped before being inlined, so a lens click on a large class cannot spend a whole context window on one turn. Also fixes a pre-existing hang where sending a message while a tool approval was still pending left the composer spinning forever. Closes #750.
- Added `@` mention autocomplete to the VS Code extension's chat composer: typing `@` opens a floating dropdown of workspace files, folders and open editors, and selecting one attaches it as a context chip. Search runs on the extension host, which merges your `files.exclude` and `search.exclude` settings into the exclude list so hidden files stay out of the dropdown, and a bare `@` lists open editor tabs with no disk I/O. Attached files are now read with a 100 KB cap and binaries are skipped, so a mis-picked lockfile can no longer swallow the context window. Closes #747.
- Added support for image uploads and pasting in the VS Code extension chat panel, allowing users to send multimodal messages (text + images) to the AI assistant.
- VS Code extension: Added `/copy code` and a Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C (Cmd+Alt+Shift+C on macOS) keybinding to copy the last code block from the previous assistant response.

- Added a copy-to-clipboard button to the VS Code extension's chat panel: hovering over a user prompt or agent response bubble reveals a clipboard icon that copies the raw markdown text and briefly shows a checkmark to confirm. Streamed agent responses always copy the latest in-progress text. Closes #746.
- `execute_bash` and custom tools now truncate long output by keeping both the head and the tail (tail-weighted) instead of only the head, so the actionable part of compiler/test-runner output (error list, failure summary, exit status) — which usually lands at the end — isn't discarded.
- Bound `string_replace` results to a context window around the edited range.
- Fixed the Atlas Cloud wizard to store provider-qualified GPT-5.6 model IDs, while preserving compatibility with existing shorthand configurations. Thanks to @RealBhupesh. Closes #803.
- Bound oversized tool results before they re-enter model context while preserving both the beginning and the actionable tail.
- Fixed `diff_edit` returning the entire modified file by limiting results to changed-region previews. Thanks to @RealBhupesh. Closes #795.
- Added a nanocoder svg pulse effect as a visual loading indicator in vscode extension. It uses the provided svg and css to create a pulsing animation that indicates when the agent is processing a request.
- Added `/commit --copy` (short form `-c`), which copies the generated Conventional Commit message to the system clipboard. If the clipboard is unavailable the message is still shown with a note, rather than being lost, and an unrecognised option now reports a usage line instead of being silently ignored. `/commit` also shows a spinner while the model generates the message, so the round-trip is no longer a silent pause - commands opt into this by declaring `progressLabel`.
- Defer ink and @/app loading in the CLI entry point until the interactive TUI branch, so --acp, --plain and auth paths no longer pay the Ink/App module-graph cost at startup.
- Fixed bash commands entered with `!` keeping the whitespace that followed the prefix, so `! git status` now runs `git status` instead of ` git status`.
- Fixed the VS Code extension's stop button leaving a request running. Two holes: `AcpSession.cancel()` aborted the current controller and immediately replaced it with a fresh one, so a cancel that landed before the turn read the signal — the window while the agent is still resolving the prompt's file references — handed the turn an unaborted controller and the stop was lost. The controller is now rotated when a turn begins instead. Separately, the extension never answered the agent's pending permission request when you hit stop: the tool card kept its spinner and Allow/Deny buttons, and because the request stayed on the pending list every later message was refused with "Please approve or deny the pending tool before sending a new message" until the window was reloaded. Stopping (or reconnecting after the agent process restarts) now resolves those requests as cancelled. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #864.
- Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'summaryParts')` when streaming from GitHub Copilot with reasoning models such as `gpt-5.3-codex`. Copilot's Responses API proxy rotates the opaque reasoning item id mid-stream while `output_index` stays stable, so the OpenAI Responses parser looked up state that was never registered and the stream died. Copilot's response stream is now normalized before it reaches the parser: a rotated id is mapped back to the reasoning item already tracked at that `output_index`, and a reasoning item that was never announced is announced first. Closes #719.
- Fixed the VS Code extension's thought dropdown expanding to nothing. Streamed tokens are batched behind a 150ms timer, and the reasoning/text routing flag was driven by the `reasoning-start` / `text-start` markers around a batch rather than by the deltas that filled it — so any provider whose ordering differs (the OpenAI Responses API defers `reasoning-end` until the reasoning item completes; openai-compatible providers reopen reasoning without closing text; some emit deltas with no start marker at all) delivered reasoning as assistant text and left the thought view empty. Routing now follows the delta type and flushes the pending batch before switching streams, so a batch always leaves on the callback it was filled for. Whitespace-only reasoning no longer emits an ACP thought chunk, is no longer stored on the message, and no longer opens a thought section, so the empty "Thought for 0s" bubbles are gone. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #853.
- Block IPv6 loopback in the `fetch_url` SSRF guard. The validator rejected `127.0.0.1` but let `http://[::1]:8080` through, so the loopback protection could be bypassed over IPv6. It now also rejects `[::1]` (and its expanded/IPv4-mapped spellings) and the `[::]` unspecified address. Closes #734.
- Fixed `filesChanged` being empty or incomplete in the `--plain --json` run report. The mutating-tool list matched `write_to_file`, `create_file` and `edit_file`, none of which are real tool names, so only `string_replace` edits were ever recorded - runs where the model used `write_file` or `diff_edit` reported no changed files at all. The list now matches the registered names in `source/tools/file-ops/`. The same phantom names were also driving two unreachable branches in the conversation-state summariser, which now recognises `string_replace` and `diff_edit`.
- Fixed the `usage` block in the `--plain --json` run report being emitted as all zeros for providers that report no token telemetry, and reading as zero total spend for providers that report input/output counts without a total. The block is now omitted entirely unless at least one token count is actually reported, and `totalTokens` falls back to input+output when the provider omits it, so downstream harnesses can distinguish "no telemetry available" from a genuine zero.
- Fixed multibyte terminal input being corrupted when an alternate-screen stdin chunk split a UTF-8 character, which could affect Korean and other IME input.
- Fixed an MCP server staying visible as connected when its initial `tools/list` call failed. `connectToServer()` now registers the client, transport, and config only after tool discovery succeeds, and closes the partially-established client on failure so its transport/child process doesn't leak.
- Fixed info, success, warning and error messages rendering their continuation lines one column to the right. Ink wraps text with `trim: false`, so when a word-boundary space fell exactly on the wrap column it became the first character of the next line - visible on `/commit` output at certain terminal widths. Messages are now pre-wrapped, and indentation the caller wrote itself is preserved.
- Fixed prompt history navigation returning an invalid value after reaching the end of the history. `getNextString()` now returns `null`, matching the behavior of the other history navigation methods.
- Fixed update checks incorrectly recording a successful check after a registry fetch failure, corrected `BoundedMap.has()` for entries whose value is `undefined`, and restored network-error classification for Node.js errno codes. Closes #739, #738, and #737.
- Fixed the VS Code extension's **Reject All** running rejection cleanups concurrently: `rejectAll()` fired the async `rejectChange()` without awaiting, so overlapping cleanups raced over shared editor state (stale tab snapshots in `closeEditors()`). Rejections now run sequentially, mirroring `applyAll()`. Thanks to @jmdlrg. Closes #725.
- Fixed short user messages wrapping mid-word in the VS Code extension chat. The message bubble carried `max-w-[85%]` on top of the turn wrapper's own `max-w-[85%]`, so the inner percentage resolved against the wrapper's shrink-to-fit width and squeezed each bubble to 85% of its own content - combined with `break-words`, "hey" rendered as "he" / "y". The bubble now uses `max-w-full` and the cap lives only on the wrapper.
- Fixed new tool calls landing back in an earlier card instead of a fresh one when a thought, reply, edit card, or plan update came in between. Closes #856.

Fixed a manually collapsed tool card re-expanding on its next update.

Reused one footer per agent turn instead of creating one per text segment.

Fixed a turn's copy button sometimes copying a newer turn's text instead of its own.
- Fixed the VS Code extension being unable to start the CLI on Windows. `where.exe` lists npm's unexecutable extensionless shim before `nanocoder.cmd`, and the first line was taken blindly; spawning a `.cmd` also fails with EINVAL because Node refuses to run one without a shell (CVE-2024-27980). Discovery now ranks `where.exe` matches by extension, the CLI is launched via the JS entrypoint resolved from the shim, and a `.cmd` that cannot be resolved falls back to a quoted shell spawn. Spawn failures are also caught and reported in the Nanocoder output channel instead of being swallowed as an unhandled rejection that left the UI stuck on "Connecting".
- Fixed the provider wizard appearing to hang after picking models. Finishing model selection with `d` returned to the raw provider template list, where the only way to proceed was scrolling past every template to a trailing "Done & Save" — a ~34-row screen that overflows a normal terminal, so the entry was off screen and the wizard looked stuck. Adding a provider now lands on the wizard's root menu, which offers "Done & Save" up front, and the template, edit, and MCP server lists scroll within the terminal height instead of overflowing it.
- Grouped the VS Code extension's streamed thoughts into a single expandable section per response instead of one dropdown per thought block. Thoughts interrupted by answer text or tool calls now resume in the same section, separated by a blank line, and the header reports the total time spent reasoning ("Thought for 12s") rather than one short duration per fragment. The section still auto-expands while thoughts stream and collapses when they stop, but stops doing so once the user toggles it by hand. Closes #854.
- Fixed an issue where the VS Code extension failed to locate the Nanocoder CLI for users using Node version managers (NVM, Volta, fnm, pnpm, bun). A fallback directory scan is now performed when `which`/`where` cannot resolve the binary under the extension host's minimal PATH. The child-process PATH is also enriched with the CLI's directory only when a co-located `node` binary is present, preventing shadowing of a user's version-manager Node. Thanks to @akramcodez.
- Setup wizard's config location picker now shows the resolved path next to each option instead of a bare label.
- Fixed a renamed session losing its manual title when reopened in the CLI. The ACP agent rebuilds the session record field-by-field on every save and wasn't carrying `titleManuallySet` through, so the flag was dropped from disk after the next message. The title survived inside the VS Code extension via its own guard, but the CLI's autosave then saw an unflagged session and overwrote the user's name with an auto-derived one.
- Bound oversized multi-file `git_diff` results to a 20-entry diffstat while preserving the total file count, and kept file-scoped results as bounded head-and-tail patches.
- Prevent concurrent file-cache reads from clearing a newer pending read.
- Fixed ACP provider discovery after the SDK 1.3 update by including the required provider identifier.
- VS Code extension: `/copy` and `/copy code` now address the whole last assistant response rather than its final text fragment, so a tool call between the code block and the closing prose no longer hides the block. Also collapses inner whitespace in the `/copy  code` intercept, reports "No response to copy yet" on an empty transcript, and replies with a pointer instead of "Unrecognized slash command" if `/copy` reaches the ACP agent.
- `search_file_contents` no longer puts a blank line between context-free matches, and decides its layout from the `contextLines` argument rather than sniffing each match for a newline. A context block that collapsed to a single line (single-line files, or when truncation dropped every newline) previously rendered with the exact-match header and a doubled line number.
- `search_file_contents` now formats results grep-style (`file:line:content`, one line per match) instead of spreading each match across three lines with a blank separator. Matches with `contextLines` still show the full multi-line context block, now with a `-` header separator matching grep's convention.
- Fixed user-typed `!` bash commands showing no output in the transcript. Previously the completed card only displayed the command, a status dot, and a token count — the actual result was sent to the model but never shown to the person who typed the command. Completed `!` commands now render their stdout and stderr (tail-capped at 20 lines, with a note when earlier lines are hidden). Model-invoked `execute_bash` calls keep their compact display.
- Add token usage block to the --plain --json run report. Downstream tooling consuming headless JSON output can now read input/output/total token counts per run, when the provider reports them. Closes #821.
- Fixed the unreadable selection highlight in the setup wizards and other list selectors. `ink-select-input`'s built-in indicator and selected-label renderer hardcode a dark `blue` that ignores the active theme and all but vanishes against a dark terminal; every selector now routes through `StyledSelectInput` and highlights with the theme's `primary` colour instead. Also raised five themes whose highlight or body text fell below WCAG AA contrast against their own background (cherry-blossom, ayu-light, everforest-light, volcanic-ash, solarized-light). Closes #827.
- Dropped `toLocaleString()` thousands-separators from strings returned to the model (`read_file`'s metadata output and validator error, `list_directory`'s per-entry size, and `@file`-mention metadata). Comma separators cost extra tokens without adding meaning for the model. Left them in place in the terminal display components, where they're actually useful.
- Return a useful preview before requiring ranged reads for very large files
- Fix notification titles showing stale project name after changing directories with /cd
- Made the per-response usage and cost footer optional. The gray footer under each assistant message is still on by default, but can now be turned off via `/settings` → Behavior → Tool Results and Thinking → **Usage & Cost Footer**, or by setting `showUsageFooter` to `false` in the preferences file. Turning it off removes the footer line entirely - both the provider-reported tokens and cost and the client-side token estimate - and applies to replayed session history and subagent transcripts as well as live responses. The preference is read per message, so toggling it takes effect from the next response without a restart, and the models.dev pricing lookup is skipped altogether when the footer is off.
- The VS Code chat panel now shows the agent's queued work, not just what it has already done. Every tool call in a turn is announced before the batch runs, so the checklist reads queued → running → done, and rows are labelled in plain English ("Reading source/x.ts", "Running pnpm test") instead of raw tool names. Queued edits read "Edit x.ts" until they actually run, and their Open Diff action only becomes clickable once the diff exists — previously the card claimed the edit was already done and clicking through raised "Change not found". File edits render as their own card with an Open Diff action again — the panel had been matching tool names the agent never sends, which made that card unreachable and left failed edits spinning forever. Cancelling a turn now settles every queued row rather than leaving the ones behind the cancelled tool spinning, which also fixes the same stall in other ACP clients such as Zed. The task checklist is now scoped to the turn that produced it instead of one card reused for the whole session.
- Pressing Escape in the VS Code extension's chat panel now instantly cancels an in-flight LLM request, mirroring the Stop button.
The listener is registered on the webview's `document` (not just the chat input) so it fires even when focus has moved to a tool card, button, or the streaming response area.
Also added a `nanocoder.cancel` command for the Command Palette.
The backend already tears down the in-flight request via `AbortController` when a cancel is received, so this stops token generation immediately rather than just hiding output, and cancelling now shows a clean "Cancelled by user" note inline in the chat instead of an error toast.

Cancelling while a tool is waiting for approval no longer wedges the chat.
Previously the pending permission resolver was left in place, so the extension kept reporting an outstanding prompt and rejected every later message with "Please approve or deny the pending tool" until the window was reloaded.
Cancelling (or starting a new chat) now answers any outstanding permission requests with a cancelled outcome and dismisses their approval cards.

Fixed cancelled tool cards rendering with the error icon.
ACP has no `cancelled` tool status, so a cancel arrives as `failed` with `Cancelled by user` in the raw output, but the webview matched that string case-sensitively against `cancelled` and never hit it.
- Improved session management in the VS Code extension:

- **Session renaming**: Sessions can now be renamed directly from the History view. A `renameSession` ACP extension method (`extMethod`) is implemented on the CLI's ACP agent and backed by the existing session manager, so a session's title can be updated in place without a full resume.
- **History view navigation**: Creating a new chat or resuming a session from the History list now returns to the active chat view instead of leaving the panel stuck on the session list.
- Typing `/settings` in the VS Code chat no longer claims the command is unsupported in the GUI. The extension gained a Settings tab, so `/settings` now points at it the same way `/model` and `/provider` point at the header dropdowns.
- Clarify read-before-edit refusal messages to specify that files over 300 lines need a ranged read
- Increased the bounded terminal content width from 120 to 200 columns so wide terminals use more available space while retaining a sane layout cap.
- Fixed **Done & Save** in the provider wizard not saving. It routed to the Configure Mode-Specific Providers screen, which a first run has nothing to say to: a user who had just entered one API key was shown four modes marked `(Unconfigured)` and had to find the `Done` row before reaching the summary. Mode-specific providers are now an opt-in `Configure mode-specific providers` entry in the provider menu that returns you to that menu when you're finished, and **Done & Save** goes straight to the summary. Mode providers already in the config are carried through a save that skips the step.
- `write_file` no longer echoes the full file contents back after writing. The model already authored that content as the tool call arguments, so returning it again was pure duplication that scaled with file size and got re-sent on every later step of the agent loop. The confirmation message (line/char/token counts) is unchanged.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.29.0

- Added the ability to attach to a running subagent session from the terminal UI for interactive debugging. This feature allows users to inspect exactly what a subagent is doing in real-time, including streaming text and reasoning. You can press `Ctrl+S` while a subagent is running to attach to it, cycle between multiple running subagents, and press `Esc` to detach.

- Added **privacy-aware prompt scrubbing**. A new `PrivacyContext` scrubs sensitive content from prompts before they leave your machine, with tool-argument rehydration and privacy session support, a `/privacy` command to inspect what is being scrubbed, and automated scrubbing telemetry notifications. Thanks to @akramcodez.

- Added an **interactive questions system for plan mode**, so the agent can ask structured questions while planning instead of guessing. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #96.

- Added **mode-specific provider and model configuration**, so each development mode can use its own provider and model. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #277.

- Added **dual TUI screen modes**, with a more reliable `/clear` and graceful exit handling. Thanks to @llupRisinglll.

- Added **multiline cursor navigation and word-jump** in the input box. Thanks to @llupRisinglll.

- Added **`--resume` / `--continue` CLI session flags**. `--continue` (`-c`) resumes the most recent session for the current directory, and `--resume [id]` (`-r`) resumes a session by id, list index, or `last`, with a bare `--resume` opening the session picker at startup. Thanks to @llupRisinglll.

- Added a **fuzzy search filter to the `/model` picker**, with a capped, centered scrolling window so large model catalogs no longer overflow the terminal and the current model is preselected. Thanks to @rakshith1928. Closes #683.

- Added **PDF and DOCX support to `read_file`** via get-md, so those documents can be read directly. Thanks to @akramcodez.

- Added a **`doctor` diagnostic command** that checks your setup and reports common configuration problems. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #609.

- Added a **`retry` command** to re-run the last user turn. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #608.

- Added **message queueing while the agent is busy** so you can type ahead. Queued messages can be recalled before streaming, are truncated properly on narrow terminals, and no longer double-dispatch. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #597, #598.

- Added **estimated dollar cost tracking to `/usage`**, with a per-provider cost breakdown and a cumulative per-call cost history. Thanks to @rakshith1928. Closes #602.

- Added a **`--json` output flag** to the non-interactive plain run path. Thanks to @OMEE-Y.

- Added a **`diff_edit` tool for nano-profile models**. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #604.

- Added **automatic diagnostics after file edits**, surfacing errors introduced by an edit right away. Thanks to @2409324124. Closes #538.

- Added the **foundation for semantic memory** (storage layer and initial wiring), groundwork for upcoming memory features. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary.

- Reworked the client to a **stateless API with history-boundary rehydration**, improving conversation reliability. Thanks to @akramcodez.

- Added a **Together AI provider template and docs**, and **MiniMax Coding now defaults to MiniMax-M3**. Thanks to @octo-patch. Added **Atomic Chat local provider configuration docs**. Thanks to @yanalialiuk.

- Fix: **`nanocoder.tune` loading and configuration precedence** from `agents.config.json` now resolve correctly. Thanks to @rakshith1928. Closes #648.

- Fix: **patch malformed SSE termination strings from providers**, preventing stream parsing errors. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #614.

- Fix: **bound slash command completions** so the menu no longer overflows. Thanks to @2409324124. Closes #624.

- Fix: **decouple console log verbosity from `NODE_ENV`** and quiet noisy LSP discovery logs. Thanks to @A-S-Manoj. Closes #606.

- Fix: **removed the `strip-ansi` runtime dependency**. Thanks to @2409324124. Closes #643.

- Docs: added a **Simplified Chinese README** and **Traditional Chinese** translations, with fixes to the Simplified Chinese copy, plus a star-history chart. Thanks to @2409324124, @jason1015-coder, and @zerone0x.

- Updated dependencies: `@ai-sdk/google`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, `undici`, `diff`, and `knip`.

- The **VS Code extension** saw major work this cycle (ACP process manager and handshake, a chat sidebar webview with tool-permission and diff UI, session persistence, and Tailwind styling). It is versioned separately from the CLI. Thanks to @akramcodez and @Dhirenderchoudhary.

- File tools now resolve relative paths against the shell's current working directory, and `cd` in bash persists across commands — so relative reads and edits work after moving into a subdirectory or worktree. File tools also accept absolute paths that point inside the project, and can still reach the project root or a sibling worktree after `cd`-ing into a subdirectory.

- Added a tabbed `/settings` dialog with searchable categories, so settings are easier to scan and filter from the TUI. Thanks to @llupRisinglll. Closes #471.

- **Added a native VS Code GUI**. The VS Code extension now ships a sidebar chat powered by the Agent Client Protocol (ACP): the extension spawns and manages `nanocoder --acp` itself - nothing to run in a terminal. Responses stream with collapsible thinking sections, tool activity renders as live cards, and file edits open in VS Code's diff viewer. Thanks to @akramcodez.
- **Sessions in the GUI**: conversations persist to disk, with a New Chat action, a session history view with resume and delete, and full thread replay (including thinking and completed tool cards) on resume.
- **Provider, model, and mode switching** from dropdowns in the chat header, with the model list refreshing on provider switch.
- **Slash commands in the GUI**: `/help`, `/clear`, and custom commands from `.nanocoder/commands`; CLI-only commands explain themselves, and messages starting with file paths are not mistaken for commands.
- **Interactive tools in the GUI**: `ask_user` questions render with one button per answer; tool approvals show Approve/Deny inline.
- **Live progress**: subagent runs stream token/tool counts onto their card, and the task tool (`write_tasks`) renders as a live checklist via ACP `plan` updates - which also lights up in other ACP clients like Zed.
- **Cancellation**: Stop ends the whole turn - the current tool aborts, queued tools are skipped, and no follow-up model request is issued.
- **Robust CLI spawning**: the extension resolves the login shell's PATH (nvm-friendly when VS Code launches from the Dock), runs the CLI in the workspace folder, validates `nanocoder.cliPath`, and surfaces the last stderr line in the crash dialog. Fixed a silent `--acp` startup crash when the working directory was unwritable.
- **Legacy WebSocket companion mode is now opt-in** (`nanocoder.autoConnect` defaults to off); extension docs rewritten around the GUI.

- Fixed static vs. live content misalignment in `--alt-screen` (fullscreen) mode. The chat transcript and the input/tools footer now share the same left column, so assistant messages, tool results, and the input line up cleanly. The fix moves the footer out to the transcript's padded column rather than pushing the transcript into the scroll viewport's clip window (which was clipping the first character of each line).

- **Removed emoji badges from the `ask_user` tool**. Questions no longer render a question-type emoji next to the prompt, and the tool schema no longer advertises them to the model.
- **`ask_user` now always shows the answer**. The tool result renders the full Question/Answer block even in compact tool display mode, instead of folding into the tool tally and hiding what was answered.

- Command suggestions now appear as soon as you type `/`, and Tab selects the highlighted suggestion. Previously the menu was Tab-triggered and often failed to render, especially in alternate-screen mode. Recalling a `/command` from history with the arrow keys no longer opens the menu, so ↑/↓ keep navigating history freely — the menu returns as soon as you type.

- **Image attachments now leave an `[Image #N]` placeholder in the message**. Dragged or typed image paths are no longer silently stripped from the user message - each becomes a numbered `[Image #N]` placeholder (mirroring the `[Paste #N]` convention), numbered after any images already attached via Ctrl+V, and highlighted in the chat history like `[@file]` mentions.

- Fixed provider configuration loading so existing providers are preserved and startup falls back to a working provider instead of freezing. Thanks to @llupRisinglll.

- Fixed Ctrl+S not cycling between multiple parallel subagent sessions. The attached-session transcript renders through Ink's append-only `<Static>`, so switching agents never printed the new agent's messages; the view is now remounted per agent with a terminal wipe (same treatment as /clear), and rapid Ctrl+S presses cycle reliably.

- -adding **typing svg in README.md showing "Meet Nanocoder" and "your private, local first ai coding assistant"** Thanks to @jason1015-coder.

- Added **Thesean AI as a provider template**. The `/setup-providers` wizard now includes Thesean's Ship endpoint with Anthropic-compatible Claude models (`ship-like/claude-opus-4-8`, `ship-like/claude-sonnet-5`, `ship-like/claude-haiku-4-5`), plus a new docs page covering configuration and available models.

# 1.28.1

- Added **image attachments on user messages**. Paste an image from the clipboard with **Ctrl+V** (via `osascript` on macOS, `wl-paste`/`xclip` on Linux, PowerShell on Windows), drag an image file into the terminal, or type a path - quoted, unquoted, and macOS backslash-escaped paths are all recognised, and `http(s)` URLs are left untouched. Attachments (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP, up to 10 MB) show above the input box and **Ctrl+X** removes the last one; references are stripped from the text and sent as image parts to vision-capable models. A missing clipboard tool now logs a debug breadcrumb instead of silently no-op'ing. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #572.

- Added **skill promotion and demotion**. Skills can now be promoted and demoted between project and personal scope, with a `--move` flag to relocate rather than copy the skill files.

- Fix: **slash commands now run with their arguments**. Once a space is typed after a slash command, the completion menu hides so Enter submits the full command with its arguments instead of selecting a completion and dropping everything after the command name.

- Fix: **the chat view no longer snaps to the bottom when a slash command completion menu opens**. The completion and file-suggestion menus now render inside the bounded input layout, so the container expands without disrupting the window height calculation that previously forced the history to scroll in smaller terminals. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #581.

- Fix: **empty frontmatter blocks are recognised** instead of leaking `---` markers into the body or throwing. `splitFrontmatter` now matches an empty block, and `extractRawFrontmatter` uses the shared `parseYamlObject` helper so an empty subagent frontmatter flows through to validation and surfaces a clear `name is required` error. Thanks to @Fadhlan. Closes #592.

- Fix: **`ask_user` unwraps label-as-key option objects**, so options expressed as a `{ label: value }` map render as readable choices.

- Fix: **surface real network errors instead of mislabeling them as context overflow**. A failed request from a network error is no longer misreported as exceeding the context window.

- Fix: **size MoE models by total parameter count, not active count**, when auto-resolving the tool profile, so mixture-of-experts models get the correct tune.

- Fix: **number formatting on the `/copy` command** output.

- Docs: clarified **MCP tool profile visibility** and documented the image-attachments feature. Thanks to @zerone0x. Closes #593.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.28.0

- Added **Agent Client Protocol (ACP) support**. Nanocoder can now run as an ACP agent (`nanocoder --acp`), exposing its conversation, tool-calling, and permission flows over the protocol so it can be driven by ACP-compatible editors and clients (Zed and others). New `source/acp/` module covers the agent, server, session, conversation loop, content conversion, capability negotiation, and permission handling. Thanks to @Avtrkrb. Closes #529. Follow-up work added the missing ACP docs, kept the parallel tool-execution loop in sync with the plain shell, and made `NANOCODER_MAX_TURNS` configurable (with a raised default) so long ACP and plain-mode runs are not cut short.

- Consolidated the **built-in tool surface from 33 tools down to 19** and added **automatic tool profiling**. Tasks collapse from four tools into a single TodoWrite-style `write_tasks` (replace-whole-list, no IDs for the model to juggle); file ops merge delete/move/copy/create_directory into one `file_op`; git shrinks from eleven tools to six (status/diff/log/add/commit/pr) with rarer operations going through `execute_bash`. A new `auto` tune profile - now the default - infers `full`/`minimal`/`nano` from the model's parameter count, so small local models automatically get the slim tool set and prompt while large/cloud models are unchanged. The resolved profile re-resolves live on model switch and is surfaced in the input indicator (e.g. `tune: nano (auto)`). `/usage` and the context indicator now rebuild from the live tune/mode/model with the profile-filtered tool count, so usage and context reporting are trustworthy. Roughly 6.3k lines removed.

- Added **structured tool results and single-source validation**. Tool arguments are now type-checked against each tool's JSON schema at the execution boundary (`schema-validate.ts`), so malformed model output returns a clear field-level error the model can self-correct from, instead of being coerced at the render layer. Validation runs through the single `withValidation` seam shared by both the native and XML-fallback execution paths, ahead of any per-tool validator. Approval policy is likewise centralised and the old global mode context removed, so the current development mode (including a mid-run switch) is honoured consistently across the main loop and subagents.

- Added **session resume with full history replay**. Resuming a saved session now replays the message and tool-call history into the chat view via a new `session-history-renderer`, so you pick up exactly where you left off with the conversation visible rather than an empty screen. Companion fixes resolved an autosave race, history-truncation, and resume edge cases, with regression coverage. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #545.

- Added the **`/copy` command** to copy the most recent assistant response to the system clipboard. Cross-platform via `clipboardy` (pbcopy / xclip / clip.exe), with a clear warning when there is no assistant message and a surfaced error when the clipboard write fails.

- Added **read-before-edit guards and tool-call loop detection for local models**. `string_replace` and `write_file` now require the file to have been read first, and a tool-signature tracker detects a model repeating the same tool call in a tight loop. Both make smaller local models materially safer to run unattended.

- Added a **skill linter** (`/skills check <name>` and a `check_skill` tool) that validates a bundle from disk with the same parsers the loader uses, so a PASS means it will load. It is wired into `/skills create` so the model verifies and self-corrects what it generates, and it lints member template bodies (unsupported mustache tags, unbalanced or unclosed sections, placeholders referencing undeclared parameters), not just frontmatter. Also added **optional command arguments**: inline defaults (`name=default`) and conditional sections (`{{# name }}`, `{{^ name }}`) in command bodies, plus inverted-section support in custom-tool templates via a shared section engine. Fixed subagents ignoring the development mode (the executor captured `normal` once at startup and never updated it).

- Added **Atlas Cloud** as a first-class provider and sponsor, with a wizard onboarding template and a dedicated provider docs page.

- Added the **Requesty** provider (https://requesty.ai) as a first-class OpenAI-compatible provider, mirroring the OpenRouter integration with a name matcher, app-attribution headers, a wizard onboarding template, and docs. Thanks to @Thibaultjaigu. Closes #589.

- Added **API-reported context usage** with an estimate fallback. The `ctx: NN%` indicator now reflects provider-accurate token counts when the model reports them (captured from the final step's `usage`, not the tool-loop-summed `totalUsage`), falling back to client-side estimation otherwise. Estimated figures are marked with a leading `~` (`ctx: ~42%`); API-reported figures render bare. Thanks to @JimStenstrom. Refs #381. Follow-up work anchored the API figure across turns, counted real tool definitions in the auto-compact gate, and added a tiktoken-based generic fallback tokenizer for more accurate counts on models without a native tokenizer.

- Added **git branch display** in the boot summary and `/status` panel, with a narrower-terminal-friendly rendering. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #539.

- Reworked **provider model discovery UX** in the wizard, surfacing real discovery errors instead of silently falling back, and showing model names in the selection list with long labels truncated by ellipsis. Thanks to @akramcodez and @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #554.

- Added **arrow-key navigation and highlighting for slash-command completion**. The completion menu now navigates with the arrow keys, with the double-submit-on-select bug fixed (TextInput ignores Enter; UserInput handles select-then-submit behind a guard flag) and `customCompletion` restored. Thanks to @rakshith1928. Closes #578.

- Added a **force-compact-and-retry fallback**. When the LLM server rejects a request for exceeding its context window, nanocoder now compacts and nudges the conversation to continue instead of failing outright. Thanks to @lordoski. Closes #546.

- Added **timeout, output limits, and abort support** to the bash executor, with regression tests covering the executor lifecycle. Thanks to @akramcodez. Closes #547.

- Custom display: **failed tool results condense to a one-liner in compact mode**. Generic `Error:` / `Validation failed:` results now render as a short red line (e.g. `write_file failed.`) in compact display mode, while the model still receives the full error in history and non-compact mode still shows it in full.

- Improved **`ask_user` prompt rendering**: dropped the leading `?` from the header, fixed spacing and the hanging indent, added arrow-key navigation, and normalised object-shaped options to readable strings (preferring a label over a value id).

- Improved **`@`-file-mention handling**: mention placeholders are kept in the chat instead of being expanded inline, and large-file inlining is capped to avoid blowing up the prompt.

- Fix: **Copilot GPT-5 reasoning streams** are now handled correctly via an `@ai-sdk/openai` patch and chat-handler changes, so reasoning content streams properly instead of breaking the response. Thanks to @EntropyParadigm. Closes #577.

- Fix: **propagate `AbortSignal` to streaming bash execution**, so cancelling a turn actually stops a long-running streamed command. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #550.

- Fix: **prevent silent overwrite of corrupted config files**. A corrupted `agents.config.json` no longer gets silently clobbered; the wizard now honours the `projectDir` prop for config-path resolution and the infinite render loop on the `existingProviders` default param is resolved, all with regression coverage. Thanks to @Dhirenderchoudhary. Closes #551, #552.

- Fix: **`read_file` returns an empty marker instead of throwing on empty files**, including range and metadata-only reads, with the `EMPTY_FILE_MARKER` constant extracted (later renamed `EMPTY_CONTENT_MARKER`) and tests for files containing only a newline. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #530.

- Fix: **prevent orphaned tool results from breaking LLM compaction**. A tool-aware boundary in the converter and summariser stops a recent-tail slice from splitting a tool-call group, which previously produced empty model output after compaction.

- Fix: **`/` key no longer scrolls the chat view to the bottom**. Thanks to @itsishant. Closes #590.

- Fix: **close the chokidar watcher if daemon startup throws**, and move the daemon stop-handler setup before resources start so a failed lockfile write calls `stop()` and cleans up. Thanks to @OMEE-Y and @rakshith1928. Closes #553, #557.

- Fix: replaced a stray `console.log` in `message-queue.tsx` with the structured logger. Thanks to @A-S-Manoj. Closes #588.

- Fix: added subagent context window overrides so delegated agents can run with a different context limit than the main session, and resolve provider names case-insensitively with custom CA bundle support for provider TLS. Thanks to @zerone0x.

- Added a `tmp >=0.2.6` override to resolve a path-traversal advisory in a transitive dependency. Thanks to @ragini-pandey.

- Large **refactor and dead-code sweep**: unified tool-call ID generation, extracted a shared `useWizardForm` hook, consolidated session-override managers, added message-factory helpers, deduped config loaders / git exec / command dispatch / conversation-loop flush, extracted `StyledSelectInput` and `makeSimpleToolFormatter`, and deleted several dead modules and orphaned exports (including `fetch-local-models` orphaned by an earlier removal).

- Updated the **Nanocoder Battlemap** competitive comparison and refreshed the README and docs.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.174 -> 6.0.193, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@agentclientprotocol/sdk` 0.22.1 -> 0.25.0, `undici`, `esbuild`, `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.0, `lint-staged` 17, `@types/node`, `@types/vscode`, and other transitive bumps tracked through the lockfile. Added `clipboardy ^5.3.1` for `/copy`.

# 1.27.0

- Added **Skills**, a unified extension primitive that brings commands, subagents, and tools under a single ergonomic surface. Two forms over one primitive: **single-file** (a `.md` in `.nanocoder/commands|agents|tools/`, fully backwards-compatible with the existing flat dirs) and **bundle** (a directory under `.nanocoder/skills/<name>/` with `skill.yaml` plus optional `commands/`, `agents/`, `tools/` subdirs). Bundles are for multi-piece features that need to ship and version together: a bundle's subagent automatically gets its sibling tools, scoped tools are hidden from the global tool list (default for bundles, opt-in for single-file), and bundle commands auto-namespace (`commands/status.md` in bundle `git` invokes as `/git:status`). New `/skills` slash command lists everything loaded, and bundled members fan out into the existing `CustomCommandLoader`, `SubagentLoader`, and `ToolManager.registry` so downstream consumers keep using their familiar registries. Closes #515.

- Added **event-triggered skill runs** via a new per-project **daemon**. Skill members can declare `subscribe:` blocks in frontmatter (or a bundle manifest) and the daemon wakes them on `file.changed` and `schedule.cron` events. The daemon (`nanocoder daemon <start|stop|status|logs>`) runs as a long-lived background process with a lockfile, Unix-socket IPC, and installers for launchd (macOS) and systemd user units (Linux). The interactive TUI never starts event sources, so file watching and cron only run when you opt in. Triggered runs execute in a new internal **headless** mode (no `ask_user`, no foreground confirmations) which supersedes the legacy `scheduler` mode. Per-subscription `confirm: true` opts into `plan` mode instead. Backpressure caps per-subscription concurrency and trailing-debounces `file.changed` by 500ms so chatty save loops don't pile up.

- Removed the legacy `source/schedule/` module (`runner`, `storage`, `index`, `types`). Schedules are now expressed as `schedule.cron` subscriptions on a skill member and dispatched by the daemon. The old `useSchedulerMode` hook, `scheduler-view` component, and the `.nanocoder/schedules.json` / `.nanocoder/schedules/*.md` storage layout are gone. The `/schedule` command has been trimmed and refocused around the new model. Closes #524.

- Added **Custom Tools**: markdown-defined, model-callable tools that sit between custom commands (prompt injection only) and MCP servers (full external process). Drop a `.md` into `.nanocoder/tools/` (project) or `~/.config/nanocoder/tools/` (personal), declare parameters in YAML frontmatter (with JSON Schema-style `type`, `required`, `pattern`, `maxLength`, etc.), and write a shell command body using `{{ name }}` and `{{# section }}` template placeholders. All substitutions are shell-quoted to prevent injection. Includes `approval` (`always`/`never`) and `read_only` flags that participate in mode policy: plan mode requires `approval=never && read_only=true`, scheduler/headless requires `approval=never`. New `/tools create <name>` scaffolds a template and asks the model to help fill it in. Project tools shadow personal ones by `name`, and they register into the same `ToolManager` registry as built-ins and MCP tools so `/tools`, subagents, and mode filtering see them through a single unified registry. Closes #520.

- Added **LLM-based context compaction** as the default `/compact` strategy. The active model writes a structured markdown summary of the compressible segment (Context / Decisions / Files modified / Tools used / Open questions) using a dedicated summariser prompt, replacing the older messages with one synthetic summary while recent messages are kept verbatim. Higher fidelity than mechanical truncation at the cost of one extra round-trip. New `strategy` field in `autoCompact` config (`llm` default, `mechanical` legacy), new CLI flags (`--llm`, `--mechanical`, `--strategy <name>`), and automatic fallback to mechanical compression on LLM failure (network error, empty response, summary larger than original). Auto-compact uses the same strategy.

- Added **OpenRouter request configuration** via a dedicated `openrouter` block on the provider config. Forwards OpenRouter-specific request body fields (`provider` routing rules, `reasoning`, `plugins`, `models` fallback list, `service_tier`, `route`, `user`, etc.) on every request - always-on transport/routing concerns, not gated by `/tune`. Provider is detected by name (case-insensitive). `tune.modelParameters.reasoningEffort` populates `openrouter.reasoning.effort` when unset; explicit values on the provider config always win. Closes #519.

- Added **config lint** at startup. Surfaces common misconfigurations as warnings before they cause silent failures - e.g. an `openrouter` block on a provider that is not OpenRouter, unknown fields, type mismatches. Includes a full test suite. Closes #523.

- Reworked **OpenRouter model selection** in the provider wizard. Replaced the previous list with a paginated, searchable `ModelSelectionList` (12 visible items, page navigation, multi-select with running counter, select-all, error state). Makes browsing OpenRouter's hundreds of models actually usable from the wizard. Closes #516.

- Added **unified Session Service** for key generation and session infrastructure. Consolidates the various ad-hoc keying strategies scattered across commands, handlers, and tool result display into one place. Touched 50 files across handlers, commands, hooks, and the chat handler, removing duplicated key-derivation logic and shrinking `useAppState` by ~38 lines. Fully closes #229.

- Added the **Nanocoder Battlemap** - a long-form competitive comparison doc covering Nanocoder against Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Aider, OpenCode, Crush, and Pi across twelve axes (license, pricing, local-model support, MCP, extensibility, tool-calling, subagents, surface, plain mode, stars, contributors, telemetry). Honest where Nanocoder leads, honest where it does not. Closes #423.

- Made code blocks **copyable without ASCII artifacts**. Reworked the markdown parser and `AssistantMessage` rendering so fenced code blocks render as plain selectable text without surrounding box borders that previously got copied into the clipboard. Thanks to @aravindinduri.

- Fix: streaming OOM on long responses. `StreamingMessage` was calling `wrapWithTrimmedContinuations()` on the entire growing assistant message on every ~150ms flush, allocating per-line arrays proportional to the full message size. A ~37k-token (~150 KB) response would overwhelm GC and crash the 4 GB Node heap. Now slices the message to a bounded tail (`MAX_LINES * textWidth * 4` chars, snapped to a newline boundary) before wrapping, so per-render work is constant in the visible window rather than linear in total streamed content. Thanks to @abhishekDeshmukh74. Closes #526.

- Fix: performance entry buffer OOM in long sessions. React 19's `react-reconciler` (dev build) calls `performance.measure`/`performance.mark` on every render, and Node's built-in fetch (undici) pushes a resource-timing entry per HTTP request. Both write to the same global buffer, which nanocoder never drained. Over long subagent-heavy sessions the buffer accumulated millions of entries until V8 thrashed in mark-compact GC and crashed with `Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit`. Fix installs an unref'd 30s interval that calls `performance.clearMarks()` / `performance.clearMeasures()` in the Ink render path. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #521.

- Fix: auto-compact ignored the per-provider `contextWindow` override. The auto-compact threshold was computed against the model's default context window even when the provider config narrowed it, causing compaction to fire late (or not at all) on providers configured with a smaller usable window. Closes #525.

- Fix: surface real provider errors instead of `[object Object]`. The error parser now extracts meaningful messages from AI SDK errors (status codes, body excerpts, nested `responseBody` fields) before they reach the UI, so model and API failures show up as actionable text instead of an opaque stringified object.

- Fix: removed dead MCP server hosts from the wizard templates. `remote.mcpservers.org` and a handful of other defunct discovery endpoints were still listed in `mcp-templates.ts` and would silently fail when selected. Companion dead-URL guard in `mcp-client` prevents the wizard from surfacing entries it cannot reach.

- Fix: markdown parser regressions in fenced code extraction. Indented fenced code blocks (e.g. inside list items) now extract correctly, fenced blocks nested inside blockquotes are no longer split out (they belong to the quote), and indented list continuations are preserved as list text instead of being misparsed as indented code. Removed indented-code extraction from the shared markdown parser entirely - only fenced blocks split out for copyable rendering.

- Fix: tightened the task management section of the system prompt to reduce over-eager task list creation on small jobs.

- Minor: nudged the system prompt to avoid markdown tables in output. Tables render poorly in the terminal even though the markdown converter supports them, so the model is now steered toward bullet lists or short prose.

- Fix: Nix packaging - reproducible pnpm 11 builds via `pkgs.pnpm_11` now that nixpkgs PR #505103 has landed. Drops the version-override scaffolding, the `chmod +x pnpm.cjs` postInstall hack, and the `manage-package-manager-versions` `replaceStrings` patch from the previous release. Also documents and works around an upstream `fetch-pnpm-deps` shell bug (`export VAR value` without `=`) that caused non-deterministic `v11/index.db` writes when `side-effects-cache` fell back to true. Re-enables the `update-nix.yml` workflow. Closes #511.

- Audit/security: updated `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `auditConfig` and `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entries to align with the versions resolved in the lockfile, keeping `pnpm audit` output meaningful. Thanks to @aravindinduri.

- Chore: added `FUNDING.yml` linking the repo to Open Collective with a custom URL pointing at the `/sponsor` page.

- Dependency updates: added `chokidar ^5.0.0` for the daemon's file-watcher event source, plus assorted transitive bumps tracked through the lockfile.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.26.1

- Bumped `@nanocollective/get-md` to `^1.4.0`, which makes `node-llama-cpp` an optional peer dependency. Drops the entire `node-llama-cpp` transitive — including ~500 MB of platform-specific native binaries (CUDA, Vulkan, Metal, ARM variants) that pnpm fetched eagerly regardless of host — from the install graph and the Nix closure. The `fetch_url` tool (the only consumer of get-md) uses the standard HTML→Markdown path which doesn't need the LLM converter, so there's no functional change.

- Patched `flake.nix` for pnpm 11 compat. Overrides nixpkgs's bundled pnpm (currently 10.x) to pnpm 11.0.9 to match `packageManager`, then handles two pnpm-11-specific quirks: `chmod +x` on `bin/pnpm.cjs` (a Corepack-compat shim shipped without the execute bit by upstream) and a `replaceStrings` patch on `fetchPnpmDeps`'s `installPhase` to skip the now-rejected `pnpm config set manage-package-manager-versions false` global write. Unblocks the `update-nix.yml` workflow that's been failing on `ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH`.

# 1.26.0

- **BREAKING**: Removed redundant `nanocoderTools.alwaysAllow` setting. It duplicated the top-level `alwaysAllow` with no extra behaviour. Move any entries from `nanocoderTools.alwaysAllow` to the top-level `alwaysAllow` array in `agents.config.json`. The deprecated `agents.config.example.json` has also been removed.

- Added **nano mode** — a third tool profile under `/tune` designed for the smallest open-weights models or low-end hardware running larger models locally. Strictly more aggressive than `minimal`: drops `find_files`, `list_directory`, and `agent`; trims `CORE PRINCIPLES` and `CODING PRACTICES`; uses ≤4-line `TASK APPROACH`, `FILE OPERATIONS`, and `CONSTRAINTS` sections; replaces the verbose `SYSTEM INFORMATION` block with a single-line `## SYSTEM` line; and omits `AGENTS.md` from the prompt by default. Brings the system prompt from ~500–700 tokens (`minimal`) down to ~150–250 tokens. Includes a new "Nano (low-end hardware)" preset and an **Include AGENTS.md** toggle.

- Added reasoning trace support. Reasoning content from models (Codex GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1-style, Anthropic extended thinking, etc.) now streams in real time, renders as a collapsible `Thought` block above the response, persists across history, and is included in logs. Toggle expansion with `Ctrl+R`, configure default expansion via the new **Display Settings** panel, and pin per-session via the tune `expandedReasoning` option. `<think>` tags are now stripped on the native tool-calling path so reasoning never leaks into rendered output. Thanks to @Daniel5055. Closes #457.

- Added refined **non-interactive mode**. A new `--plain` flag streams output suitable for CI pipelines, scripts, and pipes — no Ink rendering, no interactive prompts, deterministic exit codes, and proper handling of stdin/stdout. Includes a dedicated `non-interactive-shell` component and full test coverage for the plain transport.

- Reworked **VS Code extension** integration. Removed the "Ask Nanocoder" command in favour of a more natural flow: highlighted text and the currently focused file are automatically pulled into Nanocoder as context. Backed by a rewritten extension protocol, a simplified extension entrypoint, a new `useVSCodeServer` hook, and tighter UI hooks for the development mode indicator and chat input.

- Added `/rename` command for renaming the current chat session. Accessible from the chat input and reflected in the development mode indicator. Thanks to @lordoski.

- Added `defaultMode` config option for interactive sessions. Set a starting mode (`normal`, `auto-accept`, `yolo`, `plan`) in `agents.config.json` instead of always launching in normal mode. Thanks to @lordoski.

- Added **custom system prompt** support via `agents.config.json`. Define a project-level system prompt that replaces or augments the built-in prompt sections, with full validation and prompt-builder integration. Closes #487.

- Added per-provider and per-model **context window overrides** in `agents.config.json` via `contextWindow` and `contextWindows[model]`. New resolution order: session override (`/context-max`, `--context-max`) → provider model override → provider default → `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` → models.dev / Ollama fallback. `/usage`, status bar, auto-compact, and context reporting all use the active provider config consistently. Closes #455.

- Added subagent context window overrides so delegated agents can run with a different context limit than the main session. Thanks to @zerone0x.

- Added `disabledTools` config option in `agents.config.json` to disable specific built-in tools project-wide. Honoured by both the main agent and subagents.

- Added `--trust-directory` CLI flag to bypass the first-run directory trust prompt for automation. Yolo mode now also skips file path validators in line with its "auto-accept everything" semantics.

- Added JSON tool fallback mode for non-tool-calling open-weights models (Qwen, Kimi, GLM). The tune menu now cycles through Native ON / OFF (XML) / OFF (JSON), with `formatToolsForJSONPrompt()` embedding literal JSON Schema and a JSON branch in the tool-call parser. Native path also gains JSON/XML hallucination recovery: `parseToolCalls()` is run against text content when the SDK reports no `tool_calls`, and `stripEmbeddedToolCallText()` removes echoed tool-call text so Ghost Echo no longer leaks into the UI or history. Reference #500.

- Added `<function=...>` format to the tool-call parser for models that emit OpenAI-style function tags.

- Added **Display Settings** panel under `/settings` ("Tool Results and Thinking") with two new toggles: **Show Thinking by default** (Ctrl+R) and **Expand Tool Results by default** (Ctrl+O), persisted to `nanocoder-preferences.json`. Thanks to @cleyesode. Closes #499.

- Added 12+ new themes to the bundled theme set.

- Removed the in-repo release content generator workflow. Release content is now generated from another repo via ContentForest.

- Bumped CI and devcontainer toolchain to **Node.js 22** + **pnpm 11** across `pr-checks.yml`, `release.yml`, `update-badges.yml`, and `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`. `engines.node` raised to `>=22`, with a `packageManager` field (`pnpm@11.x.x`) added to `package.json` so Corepack pins the pnpm version automatically for both contributors and CI — no more drift, no per-workflow `version:` lines. `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `docs/getting-started/installation.md` / `.devcontainer/README.md` updated to match. Fixes the `node:sqlite` `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE` crash hit by pnpm 11 on Node 20 runners.

- Migrated pnpm config from `package.json` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for pnpm 11 compatibility: `overrides`, `patchedDependencies`, and the new `allowBuilds` block now live in the workspace file. While migrating, audited and removed all 16 existing version overrides — every one was redundant under current dependency resolution (each transitive resolved to a version already exceeding the override's floor), and removing them left `pnpm audit` output unchanged.

- Major spring-clean refactor across the codebase. Extracted shared `oauth-login` command from the duplicated `codex-login` and `copilot-login` flows; introduced shared `item-selector` component used by `model-selector` and `provider-selector`; centralised `tool-needs-approval` logic; moved AI SDK error-handling specs into a dedicated subdirectory; tightened logging method factory; and trimmed redundant code paths in `conversation-loop`, `subagent-executor`, and the plain shell.

- Refactored `App.tsx` and added missing test coverage for the app container and chat input components.

- Refactored settings theme selector UX. Replaced the scrollable `SelectInput` with arrow-key navigation, real-time theme preview, and a "Theme Name [n/N]" position indicator. Preferences are only persisted on Enter.

- Updated the system prompt to encourage subagent use more proactively for complex multi-step tasks.

- Strip leading and trailing whitespace from assistant messages so blank lines and stray newlines from the model no longer push content around in the UI.

- Fix: Empty model responses now trigger a capped auto-continue instead of crashing or burning tokens forever. Empty-response retry notices are coalesced into a single live counter so the chat history stays readable.

- Fix: Surface context-size failures explicitly instead of silently retrying empty responses. Thanks to @zerone0x. Closes #501.

- Fix: Persist compressed messages across recursive conversation turns. Auto-compact now also resets the streaming token count after compression, with regression coverage to keep it stable. Thanks to @lordoski. Closes #480.

- Fix: Throw stream errors immediately during streaming instead of swallowing them and ending the response cleanly. Thanks to @alexbrjo.

- Fix: Cap malformed-XML retries to prevent OOM when a model gets stuck emitting broken tool-call XML in a tight loop. Reference #500.

- Fix: Stale `lastProvider` after running the config wizard mid-session — the next `/provider` invocation picked up the old value. Includes regression coverage. Thanks to @electricwolfemarshmallowhypertext. Closes #477.

- Fix: Inaccurate tok/s reporting in the streaming status line.

- Fix: File search, content search, and `@mention` autocomplete now work cross-platform. Replaced Unix-only `find`/`grep`/`which` shell-outs with pure Node.js implementations honouring `.gitignore` and `DEFAULT_IGNORE_DIRS`, restored the 30s search timeout via `AbortSignal`, and added Windows path normalisation. Thanks for the cross-platform report (#469).

- Fix: Read file tool description corrected.

- Fix: Type `MCPTool.inputSchema` as `JSONSchema7` instead of `any`, with `isPlainObject` guard at the MCP protocol boundary so malformed server schemas resolve to `undefined` rather than flowing through the system as a trusted type. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #467.

- Fix: Apply `caCertPath` TLS configuration to Anthropic and Google providers (previously only OpenAI-compatible providers honoured it), with cert path validation. Companion fix for custom CA bundle support across all providers. Thanks to @zerone0x. Closes #491 (#380).

- Fix: Reject ambiguous provider names with case-insensitive duplicates (e.g. both `Ollama` and `ollama` defined). Provider names are now resolved case-insensitively throughout. Thanks to @zerone0x. Closes #488.

- Fix: Quoted custom command arguments (double, single, and backtick) are now parsed as a single parameter so multi-word values survive tokenisation. Closes #478.

- Fix: Missing margin on the live sub-agent progress component.

- Fix: `git_pr` tool still required approval in yolo mode.

- Fix: `bash` mode no longer passes the currently selected file when not relevant.

- Fix: Incorrect passing of system prompt in some chat-handler paths.

- Fix: Default missing `subagent_type` and `description` parameters on the `agent` tool to safe values to prevent a UI crash when the model omits them.

- Fix: Model context limits failed to resolve for `gemma4`.

- Fix: Scheduler — clear the perf buffer between jobs to avoid an undici fetch leak that accumulated across long-lived scheduler sessions. Refresh the base system prompt for each scheduler execution so dynamic system info (current date, etc.) stays fresh.

- Fix: Reasoning trace follow-ups — restore post-loop `flushBuffer` safety net, persist reasoning on `assistantMsg` so it survives in history, default Codex `reasoningSummary=auto` and `reasoningEffort=medium` so GPT-5 reasoning actually renders, and resolve a system-prompt cache race where "No subagents available." was cached before the subagent loader finished.

- Fix: Various test/CI breakages from merges and refactors.

- Fix: Nix packaging — removed the unmaintained `snowfall-lib` dependency and improved overall packaging. Thanks to @PlasmaPower. Closes #459.

- Fix: Homebrew formula — switched the `node` dependency from `node@20` to `node@22` to prevent the `webidl.util.markAsUncloneable is not a function` startup crash. Thanks to @matthiasbolten. Closes #468.

- Fix: Repaired broken documentation references. Thanks to @breca.

- Security: Address Semgrep findings flagged across the codebase.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.116 → 6.0.174, `@ai-sdk/openai` 3.0.41 → 3.0.53, `@ai-sdk/google` 3.0.53 → 3.0.64, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 2.0.35 → 2.0.41, `undici` 8.0.2 → 8.2.0, `react` 19.2.4 → 19.2.6, `yaml` 2.8.3 → 2.8.4, `dotenv` 17.3.1 → 17.4.2, `@nanocollective/get-md` 1.3.0 → 1.3.1, plus dev-dependency bumps for `@biomejs/biome`, `knip`, `tsc-alias`, `@ava/typescript`, `@vscode/vsce`, `@types/vscode`, `eslint`, and `strip-ansi`.

# 1.25.2

- Fixed Nix package: copy `themes.json` and prompt section files into the Nix store so `nix run` no longer crashes at startup
- Fixed Nix package: corrected wrapper script heredoc indentation that broke the shebang line

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.25.1

- Removed rogue document from `docs/`

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.25.0

- Added **yolo mode** — a new development mode that auto-accepts every tool without exception, including bash commands and destructive git operations (hard reset, force delete, stash drop/clear). Cycles between normal → auto-accept → yolo → plan via Shift+Tab. The status bar turns red when yolo mode is active.

- Added subagents — isolated child conversations that the LLM can delegate work to. Ships with two built-in agents: **Explore** (read-only codebase investigation) and **Reviewer** (code review with actionable feedback). Subagents are defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter specifying name, description, model, and allowed tools. User-defined subagents can be placed in `.nanocoder/agents/`. Managed via the `/agents` command (`show`, `create`). Thanks to @brijeshkr for the initial subagent implementation. Closes #414.

- Added concurrent subagent execution. The LLM can launch multiple subagents in parallel, each with independent tool sets and live in-place progress rendering via the `AgentProgress` component.

- Added subagent tool approval matching main agent behaviour. Subagent write tools prompt for approval and bash always prompts unless in `alwaysAllow`. The `agent` tool itself no longer requires approval since internal tools have their own gates.

- Redesigned the system prompt into a modular, composable architecture. The monolithic `main-prompt.md` has been replaced with individual section files under `source/app/prompts/sections/` (identity, core principles, coding practices, file editing, tool rules, diagnostics, task management, etc.). The new `prompt-builder` assembles the prompt dynamically based on the current mode — normal, auto-accept, plan, and scheduler each get a tailored prompt with only the sections and tools relevant to that mode. Includes a `generate-system-prompts` script for offline token counting and prompt inspection.

- Made plan mode useful. Plan mode now enforces read-only tools at the policy level — all mutation tools (write, bash, git commit/push, task management) are blocked, leaving only exploration tools (read, search, find, list, git log/diff/status). The dedicated plan mode system prompt instructs the LLM to investigate thoroughly and produce a structured plan with summary, files to modify, step-by-step approach, dependencies/risks, and open questions — instead of trying to execute changes.

- Added `/tune` command for per-session prompt and tool customization. Includes a tune selector UI (`Ctrl+T`) with tool profiles (full, minimal), a `disableNativeTools` toggle for forcing XML fallback, and aggressive compact mode. Tune state persists for the session and is reflected in the mode indicator.

- Centralized tool policy into `ToolManager` so prompt-time tool filtering and runtime approval use the same source of truth. Extracted `tool-registry.ts` for cleaner separation of tool definitions from policy logic.

- Added ChatGPT Codex as a provider with OAuth device flow authentication (`/codex-login`), streaming response support via a dedicated `StreamingMessage` component, and Codex-specific credential management. Includes provider template and setup wizard integration.

- Migrated `web_search` tool from Brave Search scraping to the official Brave Search API. Now requires a `webSearch.apiKey` in `agents.config.json` under `nanocoderTools`. Removes the `cheerio` scraping dependency.

- Added `/setup-config` command that lists all config files (project and global `agents.config.json`, `.mcp.json`, `nanocoder-preferences.json`) with their paths and opens the selected one in your editor.

- Added configurable paste threshold for single-line paste handling, with tests for the configurable placeholder threshold. The threshold is a user preference in `nanocoder-preferences.json`. Changed the default config file for paste settings from `agents.config.json` to `nanocoder-preferences.json`. Thanks to @grenkoca.

- Added live in-place task list display. Task progress now updates in place instead of appending repeated static lists to the conversation.

- Improved tool output truncation across all tools. Every tool formatter now respects terminal width for cleaner output, including `execute_bash`, file ops, git tools, `search_file_contents`, and `web_search`.

- Redesigned the provider setup wizard with a unified model fetcher that auto-detects API compatibility (OpenAI-compatible, Ollama, Anthropic, Google) and fetches available models from the provider's endpoint. Simplified the provider step UI and added MiniMax and Kimi provider templates.

- Fix: `alwaysAllow` config not being respected for `execute_bash`. Three interconnected bugs prevented it from working: top-level `alwaysAllow` was never loaded from `agents.config.json`, `isNanocoderToolAlwaysAllowed` only checked `nanocoderTools.alwaysAllow` not the top-level list, and `nonInteractiveAlwaysAllow` set `needsApproval` on AI SDK tools but the conversation loop evaluated it from the original registry entries. Closes #431.

- Fix: `dimColor` making text inaccessible to reading on some screens. Closes #440.

- Fix: Tasks now clear when running `/clear` command.

- Fix: Prevent edit flow from resolving MiniMax/Kimi to Anthropic template.

- Fix: Set correct default model for MiniMax provider.

- Fix: `/usage` and context percentage showing stale system prompt length. Added `setLastBuiltPrompt` and fixed `useContextPercentage` overwriting cache.

- Added debug logging to 15 silent catch blocks in git utilities that were swallowing errors invisibly. Operational catches now log at debug level for easier diagnosis while boolean probes (e.g. `isGitAvailable`, `branchExists`) remain intentionally silent. Thanks to @ragini-pandey. Closes #452.

- Security: Address semgrep security finding in console.error. Thanks to @brijeshkr.

- Security: Fixed vulnerable packages. Thanks to @brijeshkr.

- Security: Replaced `exec()` with `execFile()` in VS Code extension installer to prevent command injection. Removes shell interpretation from CLI discovery and extension status checks. Thanks to @ragini-pandey.

- Added `/credits` command showing project contributors (auto-generated from git history via `pnpm run build:credits`) and dependency versions.

- Added desktop notifications for tool confirmations, question prompts, and generation completions. Supports macOS (`terminal-notifier` with osascript fallback), Linux (`notify-send`), and Windows (PowerShell). Configurable per-event in `nanocoder-preferences.json` and in `/settings` with custom messages and optional sound. Includes a "Notifications" settings menu for preference management.

- Added CLI quality metrics framework (`benchmarks/measure.ts`, `benchmarks/report.ts`) tracking correctness, performance (module count, boot time, bundle size), stability (tool/command counts, help text hash), and health (test counts, vulnerabilities).

- Reduced startup time by parallelizing and deferring non-critical initialization. LLM client and subagent init run in parallel on the critical path; update checks, MCP servers, and LSP servers now initialize in the background without blocking chat. Replaced the full Status box with a lightweight one-line `BootSummary` component.

- Fix: Scheduler mode memory leak — chat messages and components now clear before each scheduled job execution, preventing memory accumulation across repeated runs.

- Fix: Updated agent documentation (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) with current project structure (766 files across 97 directories), added missing directory mappings, removed deprecated references, and documented the lazy-loading command system.

- Fix: Improved Ollama timeout handling for slow local models. Timeout errors are now detected case-insensitively, and IPv6 loopback addresses are correctly resolved. Thanks to @ragini-pandey.

- Dependency updates

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.24.1

- Added `--context-max` CLI flag for setting the context limit from the command line, complementing the existing `/context-max` command and `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` env variable.

- Removed time from the system prompt to keep the KV cache more stable across requests. Thanks to @initialxy. Closes #415.

- Task tool results are no longer displayed as compacted results during ensuring task progress remains visible in the conversation.

- User input now uses the same text wrapping as assistant messages for a more consistent chat appearance.

- Improved `search_file_contents` tool robustness.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.24.0

- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy `~/.agents.config.json` config file support. Nanocoder no longer checks the home directory for a dot-prefixed config file. If you are still using this path, move your config to the platform-specific directory: `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (macOS), `~/.config/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (Linux), or `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\agents.config.json` (Windows).

- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy `~/.nanocoder-preferences.json` preferences file support. Preferences are now only loaded from the platform-specific directory (e.g. `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/nanocoder-preferences.json` on macOS) or a project-level `nanocoder-preferences.json` in your working directory. To migrate, move your existing file: `mv ~/.nanocoder-preferences.json ~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/nanocoder-preferences.json`

- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated array format for MCP server configuration. Only the object format is now supported: `{ "mcpServers": { "serverName": { ... } } }`. If you are using the array format in `.mcp.json`, convert each array entry to an object key using the server name.

- **BREAKING**: Removed `agents.config.json` fallback for MCP server loading. Global MCP servers must now be configured in `~/.config/nanocoder/.mcp.json` (Linux), `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/.mcp.json` (macOS), or `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\.mcp.json` (Windows). Provider configuration still uses `agents.config.json`.

- **BREAKING**: Removed `auth` and `reconnect` fields from MCP server configuration. The `auth` field was never functional (both HTTP and WebSocket transports logged warnings that it was unsupported). The `reconnect` field was never implemented. Use `headers` for HTTP authentication instead (e.g. `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer $TOKEN" }`).

- Added `/resume` command for restoring previous chat sessions. Sessions are automatically saved and can be resumed from an interactive selector. Sessions are filtered by the current project directory by default, with an `--all` flag to show all sessions. Thanks to @yashksaini-coder.

- Added `--provider` and `--model` CLI flags for non-interactive provider and model specification, allowing CI/CD scripts and automation to skip the setup wizard. Closes #394. Thanks to @james2doyle.

- Added `NANOCODER_PROVIDERS` environment variable support for configuring providers without config files, useful for Docker containers and CI environments. Closes #307. Thanks to @kaustubha07.

- Added GitHub Copilot as a provider template with OAuth device flow authentication and `/copilot-login` command. Thanks to @yashksaini-coder.

- Added MLX Server provider template for local Apple Silicon inference. Closes #318.

- Added parallel tool execution allowing the model to run multiple independent tool calls concurrently for faster task completion.

- Added compact mode toggle via `Ctrl+L` in chat input to collapse the conversation view.

- Added VS Code fork support for IDE integration (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, etc.). Thanks to @kapsner.

- Added Aurora Borealis theme.

- Added notice when the model falls back to XML tool calls, informing users they can switch to a model with native tool calling support.

- Adopted AI SDK human-in-the-loop pattern for tool approval. Tool confirmation now uses the SDK's built-in `tool-approval-request`/`tool-approval-response` flow instead of manual tool-call splitting, improving reliability and reducing code complexity.

- Simplified tool processing by removing double XML parsing and the JSON tool call parser. Tool call parsing now happens in a single place and only on the XML fallback path for non-tool-calling models.

- Restructured documentation into a Nextra-compatible `docs/` folder structure with nested sections for getting-started, configuration, and features. The README is now a concise landing page linking to the full docs.

- Refactored app-utils into focused handler files, extracted shared utilities, unified mode state, and stubbed commands for cleaner architecture.

- Fix: `alwaysAllow` field in MCP server configuration was silently dropped during config loading due to a missing field mapping. MCP tools configured with `alwaysAllow` now correctly skip confirmation prompts as documented.

- Fix: Provider timeouts are now respected in non-interactive mode. Thanks to @kaustubha07. Closes #402.

- Fix: Non-interactive mode no longer exits prematurely when the prompt or response contains the word "error".

- Fix: Invalid CLI arguments no longer trigger the setup wizard. Thanks to @james2doyle.

- Fix: Installation detector no longer falsely reports Homebrew on macOS when `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` is set but Nanocoder was installed via npm. Closes #392.

- Fix: Preserve draft message when navigating through history with arrow keys.

- Fix: `fetch_url` display now truncates to fit terminal width.

- Fix: Validation failures no longer incorrectly prompt for tool confirmation.

- Fix: Various error message and `execute_bash` formatter improvements.

- Fix: Safe process metrics refactored into shared module to prevent duplicate declarations. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Security: Package audit failures resolved.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.116, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.58, `@ai-sdk/google` 3.0.33, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 2.0.30, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.1, `undici` 7.24.0, `cheerio` 1.2.0, `dotenv` 17.3.1, `wrap-ansi` 10.0.0.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.23.0

- Added `ask_user` tool for interactive question prompts. The LLM can now present the user with a question and selectable options during a conversation, returning their answer to guide the next step. Uses a global question-queue to bridge the tool's suspended Promise with the Ink UI component.

- Added per-project cron scheduler for running AI tasks on a schedule. Schedule files live in `.nanocoder/schedules/` as markdown prompts with YAML frontmatter, managed via the `/schedule` command (`create`, `add`, `remove`, `list`, `logs`, `start`). Includes cron expression parsing, sequential job queue with deduplication, dedicated scheduler mode with auto-accept, and run history logging.

- Added centralized graceful shutdown system. A `ShutdownManager` now coordinates cleanup of all services (VS Code server, MCP client, LSP manager, health monitor, logger) on exit, preventing orphaned child processes and dangling connections. Configurable via `NANOCODER_DEFAULT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` env variable. Closes #239.

- Added file operation tools: `delete_file`, `move_file`, `create_directory`, and `copy_file`. Reorganized existing file tools into a `file-ops/` directory group.

- Added readline keybind support to text input. Replaces `ink-text-input` with a custom `TextInput` component supporting Ctrl+W (delete word), Ctrl+U (kill to start), Ctrl+K (kill to end), Ctrl+A/E (jump to start/end), and Ctrl+B/F (move char). Closes #354.

- Added `/context-max` command and `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` env variable for manual context length override on models not listed on models.dev. Resolution order: session override > env variable > models.dev > null. Closes #379.

- Added `/ide` command matching the `--vscode` flag for toggling VS Code integration from within a session.

- Added persistent context percentage display in the mode indicator, replacing the previous context checker component.

- Added `include` and `path` parameters to `search_file_contents` tool for scoping searches to specific file patterns and directories.

- Added Kanagawa theme.

- Refactored the skills system into custom commands, eliminating redundant parsers, loaders, and test suites. Commands gain optional skill-like fields (`tags`, `triggers`, `estimated-tokens`, `resources`) for auto-injection and relevance scoring. The `/skills` command is removed and its functionality absorbed into `/commands` with new subcommands (`show`, `refresh`). Thanks to @yashksaini-coder for the initial skills implementation in PR #370.

- V2 type-safe tool system overhaul with defensive parsing. Implements a three-tiered defense system for handling chaotic LLM outputs, preventing crashes from non-string responses and enabling robust self-correction. Includes universal type safety with `ensureString()`, response normalization, confidence system inversion, ghost echo deduplication, and AI SDK contract fixes. Local LLM experience is now significantly more stable. Thanks to @cleyesode. Closes #362.

- Fix: XML parser now uses optimistic matching for consistency with the JSON parser. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Bash tool now emits progress immediately on stdout/stderr data instead of waiting for the 500ms timer, so fast-completing commands show streaming output.

- Fix: Recognize `127.0.0.1` as a local server URL and tighten error classification. Ollama users configuring `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` no longer experience misleading connection errors. Replaced broad `connect` substring match with specific error codes to prevent misclassifying "disconnect"/"reconnect". Closes #366.

- Fix: Skip loading git tools when not inside a git repository.

- Fix: Strip ANSI escape codes before running regex matching in tool formatters.

- Fix: Gap in layout during auto-compact.

- Fix: Hardened `write_file` validation and MCP client type safety.

- Fix: Use local `TextInput` component instead of the missing `ink-text-input` package.

- Fix(mcp): Use Python-based `mcp-server-fetch` instead of non-existent npm package.

- Security: Semgrep and audit fixes.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.95, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.46, `@ai-sdk/google` 3.0.30, `undici` 7.22.0, `sonic-boom` 4.2.1.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.22.5

- Added MiniMax Coding Plan and GLM-5 to provider templates in the configuration wizard.

- Fix: Model context limit lookups now use models.dev as the primary source instead of the hardcoded fallback table. This prevents stale hardcoded values from overriding accurate upstream data. The hardcoded table remains as an offline-only fallback. Also fixes greedy key matching where shorter keys like `mixtral` would match before `mixtral:8x22b`, and replaces first-match name lookups with scored matching for more accurate results.

- Fix: Binary and excessively large files tagged with `@` no longer pollute the LLM context window with unreadable content.

- Fix: Diff preview panel no longer steals terminal focus from the active input.

- Fix: Reduced verbosity of the `string_replace` error formatter output.

- Fix: Reject null and non-object arguments in JSON tool calls, preventing formatter crashes from malformed tool call arguments. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Restored `formatError` usage for validation and execution errors.

- Dependency updates: `ink-gradient` 4.0.0, `react` 19.2.4, `@nanocollective/get-md` 1.1.1, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.43, `pino` 10.3.1, `@types/react` 19.2.14.

# 1.22.4

- Security: Tool validators now run inside the AI SDK's auto-execution loop. Previously, tools with `needsApproval: false` (like `read_file`) were auto-executed by the AI SDK's `generateText` without any path validation, allowing the model to read or write files outside the project directory using absolute or `~` paths. Validators are now wrapped into each tool's `execute` function at registration time, ensuring validation runs in all code paths.

- Security: Reject home directory shorthand (`~`) in file path validation. Paths starting with `~` are not expanded by Node.js and could bypass project boundary checks.

- Fix: Tab characters in code blocks within assistant messages now render at 2-space width instead of the terminal default of 8 spaces. This prevents long lines from wrapping prematurely and eliminates the blocky visual effect on messages containing indented code.

- Fix: `normalizeIndentation` no longer short-circuits when the minimum indent is 0. Previously, if any line in the context window had zero indentation, raw tab characters passed through to the terminal unchanged, rendering at 8-space width in `string_replace` diff previews.

# 1.22.3

- Fix: Removed tool call deduplication from JSON parser that silently dropped duplicate tool calls, breaking the 1:1 pairing between tool calls and results expected by AI SDK. This caused "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors that would end the agent's turn prematurely. Consolidated three overlapping regex patterns into a single comprehensive pattern to prevent duplicate matches. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Added missing capture group for arguments in the consolidated JSON tool call regex pattern, which caused inline tool calls to have empty arguments instead of actual parsed values.

- Fix: When the model batched read-only and write tools in a single response (e.g. `read_file` + `string_replace`), the auto-executed read tools would recurse into the next conversation turn, abandoning the confirmation-needed write tools. This left orphaned `tool_use` blocks without matching `tool_result` entries, triggering intermittent "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors with the Anthropic provider.

- Dependency updates: `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 2.0.27, `undici` 7.21.0, `@biomejs/biome` 2.3.14, `@types/vscode` 1.109.0, `@types/node` 25.2.1.

# 1.22.2

- Fix: Markdown tables in assistant messages were rendered at full terminal width instead of accounting for the message box border and padding, causing broken box-drawing characters when lines wrapped.

# 1.22.1

- Added native Anthropic SDK support via `@ai-sdk/anthropic` package. The Anthropic Claude provider template now uses `sdkProvider: 'anthropic'` for direct API integration instead of the OpenAI-compatible wrapper.

- Fixed Kimi Code provider template to use the native `@ai-sdk/anthropic` SDK with correct base URL and configuration passthrough.

- Fix: User message token count now reflects the full assembled content including pasted content and tagged file contents, instead of only counting the placeholder text.

- Fix: Removed aggressive tool call deduplication that silently dropped duplicate tool call IDs and identical function signatures. This could cause "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors with providers like Anthropic that strictly validate tool call/result pairing.

# 1.22.0

- Added `/explorer` command for interactive file browsing with tree view navigation, file preview with syntax highlighting, multi-file selection, search mode, and VS Code integration. Closes #298.

- Added task management tools (`create_task`, `list_tasks`, `update_task`, `delete_task`) with `/tasks` slash command for models to track and manage progress on complex work. Tasks persist in `.nanocoder/tasks.json` and are automatically cleared on CLI boot and `/clear` command.

- Added `/settings` command for interactive command menu to configure UI theme and shapes without editing config files directly.

- Added `sdkProvider` configuration option for native Google Gemini support. This fixes the "missing thought_signature" error with Gemini 3 models by using the `@ai-sdk/google` package. Closes #302.

- Added custom headers support in provider configuration. This enables authentication through tunnels like Cloudflare. Thanks to @nicolalamacchia.

- Added Kimi Code provider template in configuration wizard.

- Added new themes with updated user input and user message styling for better visual clarity and consistency.

- Added token count display after messages and completion message to provide visibility into context usage throughout conversations.

- Refactored git tools for better consistency, improved error handling, standardized parameter handling across all git operations, and enhanced user feedback messages.

- Added line truncation in `write_file` and `string_replace` formatters to prevent excessive output from files with very long lines and neaten user experience on narrow terminals.

- Fix: `/usage` command crash when context data is unavailable.

- Fix: String replace error handling for edge cases.

- Fix: Multiple security audit issues resolved.

- Fix: Various styling improvements across components.

- Fix: Dependency lockfile issues resolved.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.21.0

- Added `/compact` command for context compression with `--restore` flag support to restore messages from backup. The command now includes auto-compact functionality, consistent token counting, and improved compression for very long messages. Thanks to @Pahari47.

- Added hierarchical configuration loading for both provider configs and MCP servers. Local project configurations now properly override global settings, and Claude Code's object-style MCP configuration format is now supported. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Added `alwaysAllow` configuration option for MCP servers to auto-approve trusted tools without confirmation prompts. Thanks to @namar0x0309.

- Added automatic tool support error detection and retry mechanism. Models that don't support function calling are now detected and requests automatically retry without tools. Thanks to @ThomasBrugman.

- Added `--version` and `--help` CLI command options for quick reference. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Added `/quit` command as an alternative way to exit Nanocoder. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Added `/nanocoder-shape` command for selecting branding font styles.

- Added keyboard shortcuts documentation to README.

- Renamed `/setup-config` to `/setup-providers` for clearer naming.

- Improved `/mcp` command modal with better colors and title formatting. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Improved `/help` command title heading styling. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Added CLI test harness for non-interactive mode testing. Thanks to @akramcodez.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.20.4

- Fixed configuration wizard blocking users from entering HTTP URLs for remote Ollama servers. The wizard now allows any valid HTTP/HTTPS URL without requiring local network addresses.

- Fixed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency version to resolve npm audit security issue.

- Fixed TLS certificate errors when using `uvx` MCP servers behind corporate proxies. Nanocoder now automatically adds `--native-tls` to uvx commands to use system certificates instead of rustls.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.20.3

- Fixed `search_file_contents` returning excessive tokens by truncating long matching lines to 300 characters. Previously, searching in files with long lines (minified JS, base64 data, etc.) could return ~100k tokens for just 30 matches.

- Added validation to `read_file` to reject minified/binary files (lines >10,000 characters). These files consume excessive tokens without providing useful information to the model. Use `metadata_only=true` to still check file properties.

- Fixed `web_search` result count display showing mismatched values (e.g., "10 / 5 results"). The formatter now correctly uses the same default as the search execution.

- Improved `web_search` and `fetch_url` formatter layouts to match `execute_bash` style with consistent column alignment and spacing.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.20.2

- Added preview generation to git workflow tools (`git-status-enhanced`, `git-smart-commit`, `git-create-pr`) showing results before execution.

- Fixed `string-replace` line number display in result mode - now correctly shows line numbers of new content after replacement.

- Added hammer icon (⚒) to git tool formatters for visual consistency.

- Improved formatting in `bash-progress`, `execute-bash`, and `read-file` tools with better spacing and layout.

- Simplified `string-replace` validation logic and removed redundant success messages.

- Fix: Running `/init --force` added duplication to `AGENTS.md`.

- Refactoring code to reduce duplication. Thanks to @JimStenstrom.

- Fix: Nix installation was broken. Fixed thanks to @Thomashighbaugh.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.16.4

- Decouple config vs data directories to introduce clear separation between configuration and application data directories. Thanks to @bowmanjd pushing this update.

- Update checker now attempts to detect how you installed Nanocoder and uses that to update with CLI with. It all also presents, update steps to the user correctly to do manually. Thanks to @fabriziosalmi for doing this.

- Added Dracula theme.

- Fix: Command auto-complete would only work if there was just one command left to auto-complete to. Now whatever the top suggestion is is the one it autocompletes to.

- Fix: Improved paste detection to create placeholders for any pasted content (removed 80-char minimum), fixed consecutive paste placeholder sizing, paste chunking for VSCode and other terminals.

- Fix: Creating new lines in VSCode Terminal was broken. This has now been fixed.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.16.3

- Fix: Update checker used old rendering method so it appeared broken and always checking for an update. This has now been resolved.

- Fix: Config files now correctly use `~/.config/nanocoder/` (or platform equivalents) instead of `~/.local/share/nanocoder/`, restoring proper XDG semantic separation between configuration and data. Thanks to @bowmanjd for patching this.

- Fix: Many edge-case fixes in the markdown parser for assistant messages. Outputs are far cleaner now.

- Removed message display limit, you can now see the entire session history. The message queue is very well optimised at this point so we can afford to.

- Removed `read_many_files` tool, it's rarely used by models over `read_file` and provides little benefit.

- Removed `search_files` tool as models often found it confusing for finding files and content.

_In replacement:_

- Added the `find_files` tool. The model provides a pattern and the tool returns matching files and directory paths.

- Added `search_file_contents` tool. The model provides a pattern and the tool returns matching content and metadata for further use.

- Revised `read_file` tool to reveal progressive information about a file. Called on its own, it'll return just file metadata, the model can also choose to pass line number ranges to get specific content.

- Update main prompt to reflect.

_^ All of the above is in effort to better manage context when it comes to models using tools. Some smaller models, like Qwen 3 Coder 30B struggle from intense context rot so these improvements are the first in a set that'll help small models make more accurate and purposeful tool calls._

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.16.2

- Fix: Models returning empty responses after tool execution now automatically reprompted.

- Fix: HTML tags in responses no longer trigger false tool call detection errors.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.14.1

- Switched out Jina.ai that fetched LLM optimised markdown from URLs to our own, on-device, private Nano Collective package: [get-md](https://github.com/Nano-Collective/get-md).
- `search_files` tool now ignores contents of `.gitignore` over just a pre-defined set of common ignores.
- If you use OpenRouter as a provider, it now logs "Nancoder" as the agent.
- Fix: Added `parallel_tool_calls` to be equal to `false` in the LangGraph client. This helps bring some stability and flow to models especially when editing files.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.14.0

- Added `/setup-config` command - an interactive wizard for configuring LLM providers and MCP servers with built-in templates for popular services. Includes real-time validation, manual editing support (Ctrl+E), and automatic configuration reload.
- Revamped testing setup to now:
  - Check formatting with Prettier
  - Check types with tsc
  - Check for linting errors with Eslint
  - Run AVA tests
  - Test for unnused code and dependencies with Knip
- The full test suite passes for version 1.14.0 with no errors or warnings. Nanocoder should feel and work more robustly than ever!

- Fix: Issue #55
- Rolling out testing to the release pipeline

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.13.7

- Updated `LICENSE.md` to be `MIT License with Attribution`. This was done to keep the spirit of MIT but also ensure the technology built by contributors is properly credited.
- We added a new system prompt with better instructions, ordering, tool documentation and included system information.

  - Old system prompts are dated using the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-main-prompt.md` where the date is when the prompt was retired.

- Fix: import aliases within the code now use `@/` syntax _without_ file extensions. This is an under-the-hood refactor to improve code readability and use more modern standards.
- Fix: All but the last message in the chat was made static through Ink. This still causes _some_ terminal flicker if the last message was a long one. All messages are immediately made static now to further improve performance.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.13.6

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and rolled out changelogs to releases.
- Updated the `/clear` command output UI to read "Chat Cleared." over "✔️ Chat Cleared..."
- Refactored `langgraph-client.ts` to removed old methods that are no longer needed. Rolled out this change to `useChatHandler.tsx`. This results in smaller, more tidy files.
- Fix: LangGraph errors leaked through to UI display. This is now tidied to be from Nanocoder.
- Fix: Pressing Escape to cancel model responses was not instant and sometimes didn't work.
